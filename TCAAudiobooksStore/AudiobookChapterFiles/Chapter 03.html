<!--audio start="00:00:18.068" end="00:00:22.444"--><p>'I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time
Machine,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:22.444" end="00:00:24.894"-->and showed you the actual thing itself,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:24.894" end="00:00:26.705"-->incomplete in the
workshop.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:26.801" end="00:00:28.434"-->There it is now,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:28.434" end="00:00:30.602"-->a little travel-worn, truly;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:30.602" end="00:00:34.455"-->and one of
the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:34.455" end="00:00:36.493"-->but the rest of
it's sound enough.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:36.493" end="00:00:40.097"-->I expected to finish it on Friday, but on Friday,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:00:40.097" end="00:00:42.357"-->when the putting together was nearly done,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:42.357" end="00:00:46.667"-->I found that one of the
nickel bars was exactly one inch too short,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:46.667" end="00:00:48.770"-->and this I had to get
remade;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:48.770" end="00:00:52.070"-->so that the thing was not complete until this morning.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:52.636" end="00:00:54.961"-->It
was at ten o'clock to-day<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:54.961" end="00:00:58.548"-->that the first of all Time Machines began
its career.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:58.827" end="00:01:00.760"-->I gave it a last tap,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:00.760" end="00:01:02.706"-->tried all the screws again,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:02.706" end="00:01:05.567"-->put
one more drop of oil on the quartz rod,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:05.567" end="00:01:07.848"-->and sat myself in the
saddle.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:08.022" end="00:01:14.579"-->I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels
much the same wonder at what will come next<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:14.579" end="00:01:16.050"-->as I felt then.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:16.173" end="00:01:20.417"-->I took
the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:01:20.417" end="00:01:24.004"-->pressed the first, and almost immediately the second.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:24.075" end="00:01:25.982"-->I seemed to
reel;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:25.982" end="00:01:28.946"-->I felt a nightmare sensation of falling;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:28.946" end="00:01:33.518"-->and, looking round,
I saw the laboratory exactly as before.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:33.518" end="00:01:35.799"-->Had anything happened?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:36.078" end="00:01:39.931"-->For
a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:39.931" end="00:01:41.864"-->Then I noted
the clock.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:41.864" end="00:01:44.189"-->A moment before, as it seemed,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:44.189" end="00:01:47.036"-->it had stood at a minute
or so past ten;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:47.036" end="00:01:49.866"-->now it was nearly half-past three!<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:01:50.406" end="00:01:53.306"--><p>'I drew a breath, set my teeth,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:53.306" end="00:01:57.572"-->gripped the starting lever with both
hands, and went off with a thud.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:57.804" end="00:01:59.841"-->The laboratory got hazy<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:59.841" end="00:02:01.129"-->and went
dark.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:01.129" end="00:02:06.728"-->Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing
me, towards the garden door.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:06.746" end="00:02:13.916"-->I suppose it took her a minute or so to
traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room
like a rocket.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:13.916" end="00:02:17.320"-->I pressed the lever over to its extreme position.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:17.364" end="00:02:20.368"-->The
night came like the turning out of a lamp,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:20.368" end="00:02:22.937"-->and in another moment
came to-morrow.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:23.124" end="00:02:25.789"-->The laboratory grew faint and hazy,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:25.789" end="00:02:28.409"-->then fainter
and ever fainter.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:28.453" end="00:02:31.745"-->To-morrow night came black, then day again,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:31.745" end="00:02:35.493"-->night
again, day again, faster and faster still.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:35.493" end="00:02:41.954"-->An eddying murmur filled
my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:02:42.938" end="00:02:48.006"--><p>'I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time
travelling.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:48.006" end="00:02:50.444"-->They are excessively unpleasant.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:50.488" end="00:02:54.746"-->There is a feeling
exactly like that one has upon a switchback<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:54.746" end="00:02:57.053"-->— of a helpless headlong
motion!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:57.071" end="00:03:01.968"-->I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent
smash.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:01.968" end="00:03:03.719"-->As I put on pace,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:03.719" end="00:03:06.958"-->night followed day like the flapping of a
black wing.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:07.002" end="00:03:11.613"-->The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to
fall away from me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:11.613" end="00:03:15.265"-->and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:03:15.264" end="00:03:16.832"-->leaping it every minute,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:16.832" end="00:03:19.035"-->and every minute marking a day.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:19.288" end="00:03:22.370"-->I supposed
the laboratory had been destroyed<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:22.370" end="00:03:24.546"-->and I had come into the open air.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:03:24.800" end="00:03:31.853"-->I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too
fast to be conscious of any moving things.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:31.853" end="00:03:34.204"-->The slowest snail that
ever crawled<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:34.204" end="00:03:36.437"-->dashed by too fast for me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:36.437" end="00:03:41.722"-->The twinkling succession of
darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:41.871" end="00:03:44.770"-->Then, in the
intermittent darknesses,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:44.770" end="00:03:49.211"-->I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her
quarters from new to full,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:49.211" end="00:03:52.537"-->and had a faint glimpse of the circling
stars.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:52.537" end="00:03:54.705"-->Presently, as I went on,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:54.705" end="00:03:56.612"-->still gaining velocity,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:56.612" end="00:03:58.806"-->the
palpitation of night and day<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:58.806" end="00:04:01.706"-->merged into one continuous greyness;<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:04:01.706" end="00:04:04.919"-->the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:04.919" end="00:04:08.484"-->a splendid luminous
color like that of early twilight;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:08.484" end="00:04:11.501"-->the jerking sun became a streak
of fire,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:11.501" end="00:04:13.995"-->a brilliant arch, in space;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:13.995" end="00:04:16.608"-->the moon a fainter fluctuating
band;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:16.608" end="00:04:18.795"-->and I could see nothing of the stars,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:18.795" end="00:04:22.564"-->save now and then a
brighter circle flickering in the blue.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:04:23.105" end="00:04:26.540"--><p>'The landscape was misty and vague.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:26.540" end="00:04:30.315"-->I was still on the hill-side
upon which this house now stands,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:30.315" end="00:04:33.170"-->and the shoulder rose above me
grey and dim.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:33.170" end="00:04:36.814"-->I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:04:36.814" end="00:04:38.969"-->now brown, now green;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:38.969" end="00:04:42.547"-->they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:04:42.547" end="00:04:45.891"-->I saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:45.891" end="00:04:47.994"-->and pass like dreams.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:04:47.994" end="00:04:50.815"-->The whole surface of the earth seemed changed<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:50.815" end="00:04:53.362"-->— melting and flowing
under my eyes.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:53.362" end="00:04:59.214"-->The little hands upon the dials that registered my
speed raced round faster and faster.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:59.214" end="00:05:03.158"-->Presently I noted that the sun
belt swayed up and down,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:03.281" end="00:05:05.214"-->from solstice to solstice,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:05.214" end="00:05:06.782"-->in a minute or
less,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:06.782" end="00:05:10.569"-->and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:10.569" end="00:05:15.454"-->and
minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, and
vanished,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:15.454" end="00:05:18.571"-->and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:05:19.477" end="00:05:23.735"--><p>'The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:23.735" end="00:05:26.439"-->They
merged at last into a kind of<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:26.439" end="00:05:28.737"-->hysterical exhilaration.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:28.737" end="00:05:32.408"-->I remarked
indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:32.408" end="00:05:34.733"-->for which I was unable to
account.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:34.733" end="00:05:37.998"-->But my mind was too confused to attend to it,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:37.998" end="00:05:41.002"-->so with a
kind of madness growing upon me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:41.002" end="00:05:43.753"-->I flung myself into futurity.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:43.928" end="00:05:46.736"-->At
first I scarce thought of stopping,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:46.736" end="00:05:50.132"-->scarce thought of anything but
these new sensations.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:50.132" end="00:05:54.677"-->But presently a fresh series of impressions
grew up in my mind<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:54.677" end="00:05:58.987"-->— a certain curiosity and therewith a certain
dread<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:58.987" end="00:06:02.208"-->— until at last they took complete possession of me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:02.383" end="00:06:05.348"-->What
strange developments of humanity,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:05.348" end="00:06:10.442"-->what wonderful advances upon our
rudimentary civilization, I thought,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:10.442" end="00:06:15.066"-->might not appear when I came to
look nearly into the dim elusive world<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:15.066" end="00:06:17.926"-->that raced and fluctuated
before my eyes!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:17.926" end="00:06:21.910"-->I saw great and splendid architecture rising about
me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:21.910" end="00:06:25.697"-->more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:25.697" end="00:06:27.004"-->as it
seemed,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:27.004" end="00:06:29.250"-->built of glimmer and mist.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:29.250" end="00:06:33.534"-->I saw a richer green flow up the
hill-side, and remain there,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:33.534" end="00:06:35.807"-->without any wintry intermission.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:35.807" end="00:06:40.151"-->Even
through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:40.169" end="00:06:44.383"-->And so
my mind came round to the business of stopping.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:06:45.342" end="00:06:52.977"--><p>'The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some
substance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:53.100" end="00:06:56.705"-->So long
as I travelled at a high velocity through time,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:56.705" end="00:06:58.246"-->this scarcely
mattered;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:58.246" end="00:07:01.355"-->I was, so to speak, attenuated<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:01.355" end="00:07:06.409"-->— was slipping like a vapour
through the interstices of intervening substances!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:06.409" end="00:07:10.184"-->But to come to
a stop involved the jamming of myself,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:10.184" end="00:07:12.065"-->molecule by molecule,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:12.065" end="00:07:14.111"-->into
whatever lay in my way;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:14.181" end="00:07:19.314"-->meant bringing my atoms into such intimate
contact with those of the obstacle<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:19.314" end="00:07:21.521"-->that a profound chemical
reaction<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:21.521" end="00:07:25.309"-->— possibly a far-reaching explosion — would result,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:25.309" end="00:07:29.619"-->and blow
myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:29.619" end="00:07:31.273"-->— into the
Unknown.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:31.683" end="00:07:36.868"-->This possibility had occurred to me again and again while I
was making the machine;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:36.868" end="00:07:40.982"-->but then I had cheerfully accepted it as an
unavoidable risk<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:40.982" end="00:07:44.021"-->— one of the risks a man has got to take!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:44.274" end="00:07:46.520"-->Now the
risk was inevitable,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:46.520" end="00:07:49.890"-->I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:07:49.890" end="00:07:52.594"-->The fact is that, insensibly,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:52.594" end="00:07:55.245"-->the absolute strangeness of everything,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:07:55.245" end="00:07:58.511"-->the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:58.511" end="00:08:01.815"-->above all, the
feeling of prolonged falling,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:01.815" end="00:08:04.832"-->had absolutely upset my nerve.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:04.832" end="00:08:07.627"-->I told
myself that I could never stop,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:07.627" end="00:08:11.480"-->and with a gust of petulance I
resolved to stop forthwith.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:11.480" end="00:08:14.615"-->Like an impatient fool, I lugged over
the lever,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:14.615" end="00:08:17.789"-->and incontinently the thing went reeling over,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:17.789" end="00:08:20.305"-->and I was
flung headlong through the air.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:08:20.532" end="00:08:24.711"--><p>'There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:24.711" end="00:08:27.219"-->I may have
been stunned for a moment.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:27.219" end="00:08:29.936"-->A pitiless hail was hissing round me,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:08:29.936" end="00:08:33.836"-->and I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:08:33.906" end="00:08:36.336"-->Everything still seemed grey,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:36.336" end="00:08:40.680"-->but presently I remarked that the
confusion in my ears was gone.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:40.829" end="00:08:42.448"-->I looked round me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:42.448" end="00:08:45.675"-->I was on what
seemed to be a little lawn in a garden,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:45.792" end="00:08:48.117"-->surrounded by rhododendron
bushes,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:48.117" end="00:08:55.100"-->and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were
dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail-stones.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:55.248" end="00:08:59.585"-->The
rebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:59.585" end="00:09:02.040"-->and drove
along the ground like smoke.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:02.040" end="00:09:04.687"-->In a moment I was wet to the skin.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:09:04.687" end="00:09:07.552"-->"Fine hospitality," said I,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:07.552" end="00:09:11.139"-->"to a man who has travelled innumerable
years to see you."<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:09:11.679" end="00:09:15.297"--><p>'Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:15.297" end="00:09:17.492"-->I stood up and
looked round me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:17.492" end="00:09:21.750"-->A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white
stone,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:21.750" end="00:09:26.146"-->loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy
downpour.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:26.321" end="00:09:29.359"-->But all else of the world was invisible.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:09:30.266" end="00:09:33.487"--><p>'My sensations would be hard to describe.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:33.662" end="00:09:36.326"-->As the columns of hail
grew thinner,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:36.326" end="00:09:39.069"-->I saw the white figure more distinctly.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:39.069" end="00:09:40.728"-->It was very
large,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:40.728" end="00:09:43.810"-->for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:43.828" end="00:09:45.487"-->It was of white
marble,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:45.487" end="00:09:48.700"-->in shape something like a winged sphinx,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:48.700" end="00:09:52.540"-->but the wings,
instead of being carried vertically at the sides,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:52.540" end="00:09:55.134"-->were spread so
that it seemed to hover.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:55.387" end="00:09:57.673"-->The pedestal, it appeared to me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:57.673" end="00:10:01.103"-->was of
bronze, and was thick with verdigris.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:01.226" end="00:10:04.125"-->It chanced that the face was
towards me;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:04.125" end="00:10:06.764"-->the sightless eyes seemed to watch me;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:06.764" end="00:10:10.246"-->there was the
faint shadow of a smile on the lips.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:10.264" end="00:10:12.367"-->It was greatly weather-worn,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:10:12.367" end="00:10:16.868"-->and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:16.881" end="00:10:19.807"-->I stood
looking at it for a little space<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:19.807" end="00:10:22.845"-->— half a minute, perhaps, or half an
hour.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:23.072" end="00:10:28.697"-->It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it
denser or thinner.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:28.819" end="00:10:32.097"-->At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:32.097" end="00:10:35.350"-->and
saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:35.350" end="00:10:38.728"-->and that the sky was
lightening with the promise of the sun.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:10:38.824" end="00:10:42.272"--><p>'I looked up again at the crouching white shape,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:42.272" end="00:10:46.256"-->and the full
temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:46.256" end="00:10:50.809"-->What might appear when
that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:50.853" end="00:10:53.526"-->What might not have
happened to men?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:53.622" end="00:10:57.183"-->What if cruelty had grown into a common passion?<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:10:57.358" end="00:11:01.067"-->What if in this interval the race had lost its manliness<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:01.067" end="00:11:03.706"-->and had
developed into something inhuman,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:03.706" end="00:11:07.188"-->unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly
powerful?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:07.297" end="00:11:11.242"-->I might seem some old-world savage animal,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:11.242" end="00:11:15.134"-->only the more
dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:15.134" end="00:11:18.538"-->— a foul creature to
be incontinently slain.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:11:19.314" end="00:11:22.997"--><p>'Already I saw other vast shapes<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:22.997" end="00:11:26.850"-->— huge buildings with intricate
parapets and tall columns,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:26.850" end="00:11:31.508"-->with a wooded hill-side dimly creeping
in upon me through the lessening storm.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:31.657" end="00:11:34.204"-->I was seized with a panic
fear.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:34.204" end="00:11:36.594"-->I turned frantically to the Time Machine,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:36.594" end="00:11:39.036"-->and strove hard to
readjust it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:39.036" end="00:11:43.485"-->As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through the
thunderstorm.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:43.555" end="00:11:46.194"-->The grey downpour was swept aside<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:46.194" end="00:11:49.232"-->and vanished like
the trailing garments of a ghost.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:49.485" end="00:11:53.639"-->Above me, in the intense blue
of the summer sky,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:53.639" end="00:11:57.753"-->some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into
nothingness.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:57.753" end="00:12:01.397"-->The great buildings about me stood out clear and
distinct,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:01.397" end="00:12:04.022"-->shining with the wet of the thunderstorm,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:04.022" end="00:12:09.516"-->and picked out
in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:10.435" end="00:12:12.917"-->I
felt naked in a strange world.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:12.987" end="00:12:16.618"-->I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in
the clear air,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:16.618" end="00:12:19.813"-->knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:19.857" end="00:12:21.960"-->My fear
grew to frenzy.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:21.960" end="00:12:25.043"-->I took a breathing space, set my teeth,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:25.043" end="00:12:29.257"-->and again
grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:29.431" end="00:12:32.135"-->It gave under
my desperate onset<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:32.135" end="00:12:33.397"-->and turned over.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:33.546" end="00:12:36.066"-->It struck my chin violently.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:36.066" end="00:12:39.110"-->One
hand on the saddle, the other on the lever,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:39.110" end="00:12:42.592"-->I stood panting heavily
in attitude to mount again.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:12:42.984" end="00:12:46.066"--><p>'But with this recovery of a prompt retreat<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:46.066" end="00:12:47.694"-->my courage recovered.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:47.764" end="00:12:52.631"-->I
looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote
future.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:52.754" end="00:12:57.090"-->In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer
house,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:57.090" end="00:13:01.152"-->I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:01.152" end="00:13:05.157"-->They had
seen me, and their faces were directed towards me.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:13:05.358" end="00:13:07.879"--><p>'Then I heard voices approaching me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:07.879" end="00:13:10.674"-->Coming through the bushes by
the White Sphinx<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:10.674" end="00:13:13.216"-->were the heads and shoulders of men running.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:13.338" end="00:13:19.511"-->One of
these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon
which I stood with my machine.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:19.843" end="00:13:21.684"-->He was a slight creature<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:21.684" end="00:13:23.382"-->— perhaps
four feet high<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:23.382" end="00:13:25.368"-->— clad in a purple tunic,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:25.368" end="00:13:27.954"-->girdled at the waist with a
leather belt.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:27.954" end="00:13:32.264"-->Sandals or buskins — I could not clearly distinguish
which<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:32.264" end="00:13:33.635"-->— were on his feet;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:33.635" end="00:13:35.830"-->his legs were bare to the knees,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:35.830" end="00:13:37.763"-->and his
head was bare.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:37.763" end="00:13:42.473"-->Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm
the air was.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:13:42.595" end="00:13:46.657"--><p>'He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:46.657" end="00:13:49.121"-->but
indescribably frail.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:49.165" end="00:13:53.776"-->His flushed face reminded me of the more
beautiful kind of consumptive<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:53.776" end="00:13:57.441"-->— that hectic beauty of which we used
to hear so much.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:57.511" end="00:13:59.092"-->At the sight of him<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:59.092" end="00:14:01.521"-->I suddenly regained confidence.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:14:01.521" end="00:14:03.880"-->I took my hands from the machine.<!--/audio-->
