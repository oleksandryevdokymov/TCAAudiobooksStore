<!--audio start="00:00:18.337" end="00:00:22.987"--><p>'As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:22.987" end="00:00:25.391"-->the
full moon, yellow and gibbous,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:25.391" end="00:00:29.165"-->came up out of an overflow of silver
light in the north-east.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:29.165" end="00:00:32.470"-->The bright little figures ceased to move
about below,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:32.470" end="00:00:34.977"-->a noiseless owl flitted by,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:34.977" end="00:00:37.485"-->and I shivered with the
chill of the night.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:37.485" end="00:00:41.333"-->I determined to descend and find where I could
sleep.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:00:41.482" end="00:00:43.689"--><p>'I looked for the building I knew.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:43.689" end="00:00:49.240"-->Then my eye travelled along to
the figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:49.240" end="00:00:52.984"-->growing
distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:53.002" end="00:00:55.888"-->I could see
the silver birch against it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:55.888" end="00:01:00.303"-->There was the tangle of rhododendron
bushes, black in the pale light,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:00.303" end="00:01:02.401"-->and there was the little lawn.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:01:02.602" end="00:01:04.640"-->I looked at the lawn again.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:07.835"-->A queer doubt chilled my complacency.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:01:07.853" end="00:01:11.209"-->"No," said I stoutly to myself,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:11.209" end="00:01:13.438"-->"that was not the lawn."<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:01:13.769" end="00:01:16.042"--><p>'But it <i>was</i> the lawn.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:16.042" end="00:01:19.921"-->For the white leprous face of the sphinx was
towards it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:19.921" end="00:01:24.832"-->Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came
home to me?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:24.832" end="00:01:29.177"-->But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:01:29.391" end="00:01:35.216"--><p>'At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of
losing my own age,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:35.216" end="00:01:38.333"-->of being left helpless in this strange new world.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:01:38.507" end="00:01:42.491"-->The bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:42.491" end="00:01:46.566"-->I could
feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:46.566" end="00:01:49.635"-->In another
moment I was in a passion of fear<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:49.635" end="00:01:53.162"-->and running with great leaping
strides down the slope.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:53.162" end="00:01:56.323"-->Once I fell headlong and cut my face;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:56.323" end="00:02:00.685"-->I lost
no time in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:00.685" end="00:02:03.515"-->with a
warm trickle down my cheek and chin.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:03.559" end="00:02:07.046"-->All the time I ran I was saying
to myself:<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:07.046" end="00:02:11.182"-->"They have moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes
out of the way."<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:11.461" end="00:02:14.608"-->Nevertheless, I ran with all my might.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:14.608" end="00:02:19.363"-->All the
time, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:02:19.363" end="00:02:22.288"-->I knew that such assurance was folly,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:22.288" end="00:02:26.951"-->knew instinctively that the
machine was removed out of my reach.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:26.951" end="00:02:29.407"-->My breath came with pain.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:29.407" end="00:02:33.874"-->I
suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the
little lawn,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:33.874" end="00:02:37.035"-->two miles perhaps, in ten minutes.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:37.035" end="00:02:39.164"-->And I am not a young
man.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:39.163" end="00:02:41.462"-->I cursed aloud, as I ran,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:41.462" end="00:02:44.414"-->at my confident folly in leaving the
machine,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:44.414" end="00:02:46.556"-->wasting good breath thereby.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:46.556" end="00:02:49.547"-->I cried aloud, and none
answered.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:49.547" end="00:02:53.448"-->Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit
world.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:02:54.119" end="00:02:57.750"--><p>'When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realized.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:57.750" end="00:03:00.662"-->Not a trace
of the thing was to be seen.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:00.662" end="00:03:06.279"-->I felt faint and cold when I faced the
empty space among the black tangle of bushes.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:06.279" end="00:03:08.538"-->I ran round it
furiously,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:08.538" end="00:03:11.242"-->as if the thing might be hidden in a corner,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:11.242" end="00:03:15.168"-->and then
stopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:15.683" end="00:03:19.862"-->Above me towered
the sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:19.862" end="00:03:21.495"-->white, shining,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:21.495" end="00:03:24.377"-->leprous, in
the light of the rising moon.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:24.473" end="00:03:28.034"-->It seemed to smile in mockery of my
dismay.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:03:28.626" end="00:03:35.170"--><p>'I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put
the mechanism in some shelter for me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:35.170" end="00:03:39.776"-->had I not felt assured of
their physical and intellectual inadequacy.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:39.794" end="00:03:41.818"-->That is what dismayed
me:<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:41.818" end="00:03:45.933"-->the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:45.933" end="00:03:49.720"-->through whose
intervention my invention had vanished.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:49.720" end="00:03:52.450"-->Yet, for one thing I felt
assured:<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:52.450" end="00:03:56.186"-->unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:03:56.186" end="00:03:59.072"-->the machine could not have moved in time.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:59.072" end="00:04:01.240"-->The attachment of the
levers<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:01.240" end="00:04:03.173"-->— I will show you the method later<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:03.173" end="00:04:07.954"-->— prevented any one from
tampering with it in that way when they were removed.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:07.954" end="00:04:11.768"-->It had moved,
and was hid, only in space.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:11.768" end="00:04:14.493"-->But then, where could it be?<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:04:15.085" end="00:04:18.782"--><p>'I think I must have had a kind of frenzy.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:18.800" end="00:04:24.520"-->I remember running
violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:04:24.520" end="00:04:28.042"-->and startling some white animal that, in the dim light,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:28.042" end="00:04:30.053"-->I took for a
small deer.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:30.053" end="00:04:32.888"-->I remember, too, late that night,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:32.888" end="00:04:39.235"-->beating the bushes
with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding
from the broken twigs.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:39.235" end="00:04:43.742"-->Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of
mind,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:43.742" end="00:04:46.545"-->I went down to the great building of stone.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:46.615" end="00:04:50.672"-->The big hall was
dark, silent, and deserted.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:50.768" end="00:04:53.172"-->I slipped on the uneven floor,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:53.172" end="00:04:57.464"-->and fell
over one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:57.665" end="00:05:02.741"-->I lit a
match and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:05:02.994" end="00:05:07.252"--><p>'There I found a second great hall covered with cushions,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:07.252" end="00:05:11.962"-->upon
which, perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:12.084" end="00:05:16.107"-->I
have no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:16.107" end="00:05:20.666"-->coming
suddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:20.666" end="00:05:23.304"-->and the
splutter and flare of a match.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:23.304" end="00:05:26.112"-->For they had forgotten about matches.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:05:26.112" end="00:05:28.319"-->"Where is my Time Machine?"<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:28.319" end="00:05:31.363"-->I began, bawling like an angry child,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:05:31.363" end="00:05:34.845"-->laying hands upon them and shaking them up together.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:35.020" end="00:05:37.554"-->It must have
been very queer to them.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:37.554" end="00:05:39.017"-->Some laughed,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:39.017" end="00:05:41.354"-->[most] some of them looked sorely
frightened.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:41.354" end="00:05:43.588"-->When I saw them standing round me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:43.588" end="00:05:50.301"-->it came into my head
that I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do
under the circumstances,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:50.301" end="00:05:53.653"-->in trying to revive the sensation of fear.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:05:53.906" end="00:05:57.211"-->For, reasoning from their daylight behaviour,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:57.211" end="00:05:59.805"-->I thought that fear
must be forgotten.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:06:00.228" end="00:06:03.363"--><p>'Abruptly, I dashed down the match,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:03.363" end="00:06:06.184"-->and, knocking one of the people
over in my course,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:06.184" end="00:06:09.449"-->went blundering across the big dining-hall again,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:06:09.449" end="00:06:11.286"-->out under the moonlight.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:11.356" end="00:06:16.746"-->I heard cries of terror and their little
feet running and stumbling this way and that.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:16.894" end="00:06:21.526"-->I do not remember all
I did as the moon crept up the sky.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:21.526" end="00:06:26.542"-->I suppose it was the unexpected
nature of my loss that maddened me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:26.542" end="00:06:29.859"-->I felt hopelessly cut off from
my own kind<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:29.859" end="00:06:33.159"-->— a strange animal in an unknown world.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:33.195" end="00:06:36.094"-->I must have raved
to and fro,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:36.094" end="00:06:39.263"-->screaming and crying upon God and Fate.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:39.333" end="00:06:42.089"-->I have a memory
of horrible fatigue,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:42.089" end="00:06:45.276"-->as the long night of despair wore away;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:45.276" end="00:06:48.607"-->of
looking in this impossible place and that;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:48.607" end="00:06:54.511"-->of groping among moon-lit
ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:54.511" end="00:06:57.802"-->at last,
of lying on the ground near the sphinx<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:57.802" end="00:07:00.840"-->and weeping with absolute
wretchedness.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:00.840" end="00:07:03.644"-->I had nothing left but misery.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:03.740" end="00:07:05.921"-->Then I slept,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:05.921" end="00:07:08.742"-->and when
I woke again it was full day,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:08.742" end="00:07:13.453"-->and a couple of sparrows were hopping
round me on the turf within reach of my arm.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:14.024" end="00:07:16.767"--><p>'I sat up in the freshness of the morning,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:16.767" end="00:07:19.379"-->trying to remember how
I had got there,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:19.379" end="00:07:23.802"-->and why I had such a profound sense of desertion
and despair.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:24.081" end="00:07:26.955"-->Then things came clear in my mind.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:26.955" end="00:07:29.724"-->With the plain,
reasonable daylight,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:29.724" end="00:07:33.355"-->I could look my circumstances fairly in the
face.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:33.355" end="00:07:36.907"-->I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:36.907" end="00:07:38.971"-->and I could
reason with myself.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:38.971" end="00:07:41.701"-->"Suppose the worst?" I said.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:41.701" end="00:07:44.300"-->"Suppose the
machine altogether lost —<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:44.300" end="00:07:46.111"-->perhaps destroyed?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:46.233" end="00:07:49.106"-->It behoves me to be
calm and patient,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:49.106" end="00:07:50.948"-->to learn the way of the people,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:50.948" end="00:07:53.965"-->to get a clear
idea of the method of my loss,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:53.965" end="00:07:56.943"-->and the means of getting materials
and tools;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:56.943" end="00:08:00.530"-->so that in the end, perhaps, I may make another."<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:00.809" end="00:08:03.761"-->That
would be my only hope, perhaps,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:03.761" end="00:08:05.655"-->but better than despair.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:05.655" end="00:08:07.340"-->And, after
all,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:07.340" end="00:08:10.352"-->it was a beautiful and curious world.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:08:11.049" end="00:08:14.981"--><p>'But probably, the machine had only been taken away.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:14.981" end="00:08:18.390"-->Still, I must
be calm and patient,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:18.390" end="00:08:22.682"-->find its hiding-place, and recover it by force
or cunning.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:22.778" end="00:08:26.239"-->And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about
me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:26.239" end="00:08:28.329"-->wondering where I could bathe.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:28.329" end="00:08:31.603"-->I felt weary, stiff, and
travel-soiled.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:31.699" end="00:08:36.075"-->The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal
freshness.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:36.075" end="00:08:38.334"-->I had exhausted my emotion.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:38.334" end="00:08:41.351"-->Indeed, as I went about
my business,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:41.351" end="00:08:45.565"-->I found myself wondering at my intense excitement
overnight.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:45.635" end="00:08:49.823"-->I made a careful examination of the ground about the
little lawn.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:49.893" end="00:08:52.963"-->I wasted some time in futile questionings,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:52.963" end="00:08:55.588"-->conveyed, as
well as I was able,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:55.588" end="00:08:58.496"-->to such of the little people as came by.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:58.906" end="00:09:01.753"-->They
all failed to understand my gestures;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:01.753" end="00:09:03.882"-->some were simply stolid,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:03.882" end="00:09:06.808"-->some
thought it was a jest and laughed at me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:06.808" end="00:09:12.484"-->I had the hardest task in
the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:12.528" end="00:09:14.644"-->It was
a foolish impulse,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:14.644" end="00:09:19.059"-->but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger
was ill curbed<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:19.059" end="00:09:22.672"-->and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:09:23.004" end="00:09:25.459"-->The turf gave me better counsel.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:25.459" end="00:09:27.536"-->I found a groove ripped in it,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:27.536" end="00:09:32.003"-->about
midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:09:32.003" end="00:09:36.556"-->where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:09:36.835" end="00:09:39.774"-->There were other signs of removal about,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:39.774" end="00:09:44.537"-->with queer narrow
footprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:44.607" end="00:09:48.212"-->This directed
my closer attention to the pedestal.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:48.212" end="00:09:51.020"-->It was, as I think I have said,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:09:51.020" end="00:09:52.378"-->of bronze.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:52.378" end="00:09:54.285"-->It was not a mere block,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:54.285" end="00:09:58.447"-->but highly decorated with deep
framed panels on either side.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:58.648" end="00:10:01.038"-->I went and rapped at these.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:01.038" end="00:10:02.927"-->The
pedestal was hollow.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:02.971" end="00:10:08.339"-->Examining the panels with care I found them
discontinuous with the frames.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:08.339" end="00:10:11.055"-->There were no handles or keyholes,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:10:11.054" end="00:10:14.086"-->but possibly the panels, if they were doors,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:14.086" end="00:10:17.020"-->as I supposed, opened
from within.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:17.377" end="00:10:20.303"-->One thing was clear enough to my mind.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:20.303" end="00:10:22.733"-->It took no very
great mental effort<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:22.733" end="00:10:26.442"-->to infer that my Time Machine was inside that
pedestal.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:26.442" end="00:10:29.376"-->But how it got there was a different problem.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:10:30.726" end="00:10:33.848"--><p>'I saw the heads of two orange-clad people<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:33.848" end="00:10:38.837"-->coming through the bushes
and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:38.837" end="00:10:42.351"-->I turned
smiling to them and beckoned them to me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:42.351" end="00:10:43.657"-->They came,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:43.657" end="00:10:46.530"-->and then,
pointing to the bronze pedestal,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:46.530" end="00:10:49.725"-->I tried to intimate my wish to open
it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:49.848" end="00:10:54.662"-->But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:54.680" end="00:10:57.902"-->I
don't know how to convey their expression to you.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:58.155" end="00:11:04.280"-->Suppose you were
to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:04.280" end="00:11:06.195"-->— it is
how she would look.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:06.213" end="00:11:10.759"-->They went off as if they had received the last
possible insult.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:10.759" end="00:11:14.102"-->I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:11:14.102" end="00:11:16.218"-->with exactly the same result.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:16.218" end="00:11:20.137"-->Somehow, his manner made me feel
ashamed of myself.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:20.137" end="00:11:22.017"-->But, as you know,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:22.017" end="00:11:24.003"-->I wanted the Time Machine,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:24.003" end="00:11:26.040"-->and
I tried him once more.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:26.040" end="00:11:28.757"-->As he turned off, like the others,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:28.757" end="00:11:31.382"-->my temper
got the better of me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:31.382" end="00:11:33.720"-->In three strides I was after him,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:33.720" end="00:11:36.855"-->had him by
the loose part of his robe round the neck,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:36.855" end="00:11:39.964"-->and began dragging him
towards the sphinx.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:39.964" end="00:11:44.078"-->Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his
face,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:44.078" end="00:11:46.751"-->and all of a sudden I let him go.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:11:47.552" end="00:11:50.112"--><p>'But I was not beaten yet.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:50.112" end="00:11:53.182"-->I banged with my fist at the bronze
panels.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:53.182" end="00:11:56.264"-->I thought I heard something stir inside<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:56.264" end="00:12:00.679"-->— to be explicit,
I thought I heard a sound like a chuckle<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:00.679" end="00:12:02.907"-->— but I must have been
mistaken.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:03.056" end="00:12:05.537"-->Then I got a big pebble from the river,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:05.616" end="00:12:09.822"-->and came and
hammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:09.822" end="00:12:13.087"-->and the
verdigris came off in powdery flakes.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:13.087" end="00:12:19.448"-->The delicate little people
must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on
either hand,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:19.448" end="00:12:21.315"-->but nothing came of it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:21.315" end="00:12:24.111"-->I saw a crowd of them upon the
slopes,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:24.111" end="00:12:25.947"-->looking furtively at me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:26.122" end="00:12:28.760"-->At last, hot and tired,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:28.760" end="00:12:31.255"-->I sat down
to watch the place.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:31.255" end="00:12:33.919"-->But I was too restless to watch long;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:33.919" end="00:12:36.871"-->I am too
Occidental for a long vigil.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:36.871" end="00:12:39.471"-->I could work at a problem for years,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:12:39.471" end="00:12:42.396"-->but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:42.396" end="00:12:44.128"-->— that is another matter.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:12:44.460" end="00:12:46.680"--><p>'I got up after a time,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:46.680" end="00:12:50.816"-->and began walking aimlessly through the
bushes towards the hill again.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:51.069" end="00:12:54.177"-->"Patience," said I to myself.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:54.177" end="00:12:58.070"-->"If you
want your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:58.070" end="00:13:00.708"-->If they
mean to take your machine away,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:00.708" end="00:13:03.843"-->it's little good your wrecking their
bronze panels,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:03.843" end="00:13:05.175"-->and if they don't,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:05.175" end="00:13:08.257"-->you will get it back as soon as
you can ask for it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:08.257" end="00:13:13.730"-->To sit among all those unknown things before a
puzzle like that is hopeless.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:13.730" end="00:13:16.193"-->That way lies monomania.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:16.773" end="00:13:20.300"-->Face this
world. Learn its ways, watch it,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:20.300" end="00:13:23.704"-->be careful of too hasty guesses
at its meaning.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:23.722" end="00:13:26.969"-->In the end you will find clues to it all."<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:28.215" end="00:13:33.504"-->Then
suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind:<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:33.504" end="00:13:38.729"-->the thought
of the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the future
age,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:38.729" end="00:13:42.211"-->and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:42.282" end="00:13:46.670"-->I had made
myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:46.670" end="00:13:48.825"-->that ever a
man devised.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:48.825" end="00:13:51.477"-->Although it was at my own expense,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:51.477" end="00:13:53.188"-->I could not help
myself.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:53.188" end="00:13:56.409"-->I laughed aloud.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:13:58.125" end="00:14:00.280"--><p>'Going through the big palace,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:00.280" end="00:14:03.632"-->it seemed to me that the little
people avoided me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:03.767" end="00:14:05.909"-->It may have been my fancy,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:05.909" end="00:14:10.246"-->or it may have had
something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:10.246" end="00:14:13.890"-->Yet I felt
tolerably sure of the avoidance.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:13.890" end="00:14:16.881"-->I was careful, however, to show no
concern<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:16.881" end="00:14:19.480"-->and to abstain from any pursuit of them,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:19.480" end="00:14:23.589"-->and in the course
of a day or two things got back to the old footing.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:23.790" end="00:14:26.912"-->I made what
progress I could in the language,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:26.912" end="00:14:30.917"-->and in addition I pushed my
explorations here and there.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:31.379" end="00:14:33.847"-->Either I missed some subtle point<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:33.847" end="00:14:36.833"-->or
their language was excessively simple<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:37.517" end="00:14:42.455"-->— almost exclusively composed
of concrete substantives and verbs.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:42.455" end="00:14:45.707"-->There seemed to be few, if any,
abstract terms,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:45.707" end="00:14:48.606"-->or little use of figurative language.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:48.606" end="00:14:52.407"-->Their
sentences were usually simple and of two words,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:52.407" end="00:14:57.475"-->and I failed to
convey or understand any but the simplest propositions.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:57.475" end="00:15:00.505"-->I determined
to put the thought of my Time Machine<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:00.610" end="00:15:03.692"-->and the mystery of the bronze
doors under the sphinx<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:03.692" end="00:15:06.539"-->as much as possible in a corner of memory,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:15:06.539" end="00:15:11.380"-->until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural
way.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:11.529" end="00:15:14.611"-->Yet a certain feeling, you may understand,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:14.611" end="00:15:19.243"-->tethered me in a
circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:15:20.071" end="00:15:26.889"--><p>'So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant
richness as the Thames valley.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:26.889" end="00:15:32.061"-->From every hill I climbed I saw the
same abundance of splendid buildings,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:32.061" end="00:15:35.052"-->endlessly varied in material
and style,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:35.052" end="00:15:38.226"-->the same clustering thickets of evergreens,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:38.226" end="00:15:41.975"-->the same
blossom-laden trees and tree-ferns.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:41.975" end="00:15:44.861"-->Here and there water shone like
silver,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:44.861" end="00:15:49.002"-->and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:49.002" end="00:15:52.615"-->and
so faded into the serenity of the sky.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:52.685" end="00:15:57.008"-->A peculiar feature, which
presently attracted my attention,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:57.008" end="00:16:00.273"-->was the presence of certain
circular wells,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:00.273" end="00:16:04.513"-->several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:16:04.557" end="00:16:06.935"-->One lay by the path up the hill,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:07.065" end="00:16:09.677"-->which I had followed during my
first walk.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:09.677" end="00:16:12.917"-->Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:12.917" end="00:16:17.575"-->curiously
wrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:17.645" end="00:16:23.313"-->Sitting by
the side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:16:23.313" end="00:16:25.403"-->I could see no gleam of water,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:25.403" end="00:16:28.930"-->nor could I start any reflection
with a lighted match.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:28.930" end="00:16:32.378"-->But in all of them I heard a certain sound:<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:16:32.378" end="00:16:36.069"-->a thud — thud — thud,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:36.348" end="00:16:39.157"-->like the beating of some big engine;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:39.157" end="00:16:42.553"-->and I
discovered, from the flaring of my matches,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:42.553" end="00:16:46.322"-->that a steady current of
air set down the shafts.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:46.706" end="00:16:50.637"-->Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the
throat of one,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:50.637" end="00:16:53.485"-->and, instead of fluttering slowly down,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:53.485" end="00:16:56.628"-->it was at
once sucked swiftly out of sight.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:16:57.429" end="00:17:02.079"--><p>'After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:17:02.079" end="00:17:04.678"-->standing here and there upon the slopes;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:04.678" end="00:17:08.505"-->for above them there was
often just such a flicker in the air<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:08.505" end="00:17:12.920"-->as one sees on a hot day above
a sun-scorched beach.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:12.938" end="00:17:14.806"-->Putting things together,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:14.806" end="00:17:20.748"-->I reached a strong
suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:20.748" end="00:17:24.205"-->whose
true import it was difficult to imagine.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:24.562" end="00:17:27.305"-->I was at first inclined to
associate it<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:27.305" end="00:17:29.970"-->with the sanitary apparatus of these people.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:30.461" end="00:17:32.577"-->It was an
obvious conclusion,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:32.577" end="00:17:35.033"-->but it was absolutely wrong.<!--/audio-->

tale of London which a negro, fresh from Central Africa,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:15.888" end="00:18:17.934"-->would take
back to his tribe!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:18.082" end="00:18:22.628"-->What would he know of railway companies, of
social movements,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:22.628" end="00:18:25.175"-->of telephone and telegraph wires,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:25.175" end="00:18:27.473"-->of the Parcels
Delivery Company,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:27.473" end="00:18:30.046"-->and postal orders and the like?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:30.046" end="00:18:34.783"-->Yet we, at least,
should be willing enough to explain these things to him!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:35.114" end="00:18:37.217"-->And even of
what he knew,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:37.217" end="00:18:42.154"-->how much could he make his untravelled friend either
apprehend or believe?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:42.154" end="00:18:47.940"-->Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro
and a white man of our own times,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:47.940" end="00:18:53.042"-->and how wide the interval between
myself and these of the Golden Age!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:54.105" end="00:18:57.423"-->I was sensible of much which was
unseen,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:57.423" end="00:18:59.813"-->and which contributed to my comfort;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:59.813" end="00:19:04.097"-->but save for a general
impression of automatic organization,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:04.097" end="00:19:08.520"-->I fear I can convey very
little of the difference to your mind.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:19:09.113" end="00:19:12.169"--><p>'In the matter of sepulture, for instance,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:12.169" end="00:19:14.651"-->I could see no signs of
crematoria<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:14.651" end="00:19:17.485"-->nor anything suggestive of tombs.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:17.503" end="00:19:20.494"-->But it occurred to me
that, possibly,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:20.494" end="00:19:23.545"-->there might be cemeteries (or crematoria)<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:23.545" end="00:19:26.628"-->somewhere
beyond the range of my explorings.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:26.628" end="00:19:30.781"-->This, again, was a question I
deliberately put to myself,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:30.781" end="00:19:35.256"-->and my curiosity was at first entirely
defeated upon the point.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:35.483" end="00:19:37.364"-->The thing puzzled me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:37.364" end="00:19:39.793"-->and I was led to make
a further remark,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:39.793" end="00:19:41.917"-->which puzzled me still more:<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:42.040" end="00:19:46.254"-->that aged and infirm
among this people there were none.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:19:47.186" end="00:19:53.207"--><p>'I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an
automatic civilization<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:53.207" end="00:19:56.846"-->and a decadent humanity did not long endure.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:19:57.073" end="00:19:59.511"-->Yet I could think of no other.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:59.633" end="00:20:02.071"-->Let me put my difficulties.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:02.233" end="00:20:07.457"-->The
several big palaces I had explored were mere living places,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:07.457" end="00:20:10.304"-->great
dining-halls and sleeping apartments.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:10.304" end="00:20:12.616"-->I could find no machinery,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:12.616" end="00:20:15.019"-->no
appliances of any kind.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:15.019" end="00:20:20.610"-->Yet these people were clothed in pleasant
fabrics that must at times need renewal,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:20.610" end="00:20:23.470"-->and their sandals, though
undecorated,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:23.470" end="00:20:26.404"-->were fairly complex specimens of metalwork.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:26.553" end="00:20:29.478"-->Somehow
such things must be made.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:29.478" end="00:20:33.775"-->And the little people displayed no vestige
of a creative tendency.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:33.775" end="00:20:36.610"-->There were no shops, no workshops,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:36.610" end="00:20:39.379"-->no sign
of importations among them.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:39.379" end="00:20:42.370"-->They spent all their time in playing
gently,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:42.370" end="00:20:44.068"-->in bathing in the river,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:44.068" end="00:20:47.059"-->in making love in a half-playful
fashion,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:47.059" end="00:20:49.423"-->in eating fruit and sleeping.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:49.423" end="00:20:52.174"-->I could not see how things
were kept going.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:20:52.610" end="00:20:55.823"--><p>'Then, again, about the Time Machine:<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:55.823" end="00:20:58.331"-->something, I knew not what,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:20:58.331" end="00:21:03.668"-->had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:03.895" end="00:21:06.755"-->For
the life of me I could not imagine.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:06.755" end="00:21:09.341"-->Those waterless wells, too,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:21:09.341" end="00:21:11.361"-->those flickering pillars.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:11.483" end="00:21:13.790"-->I felt I lacked a clue.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:13.790" end="00:21:17.037"-->I felt — how shall
I put it?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:17.108" end="00:21:19.602"-->Suppose you found an inscription,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:19.602" end="00:21:23.499"-->with sentences here and
there in excellent plain English,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:23.499" end="00:21:25.433"-->and interpolated therewith,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:25.433" end="00:21:28.933"-->others
made up of words, of letters even,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:28.933" end="00:21:31.402"-->absolutely unknown to you?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:31.402" end="00:21:33.948"-->Well,
on the third day of my visit,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:33.948" end="00:21:40.304"-->that was how the world of Eight
Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to
me!<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:21:41.158" end="00:21:44.850"--><p>'That day, too, I made a friend — of a sort.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:44.920" end="00:21:46.513"-->It happened that,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:46.513" end="00:21:50.445"-->as I
was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:50.445" end="00:21:54.345"-->one of
them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:54.350" end="00:21:56.962"-->The main
current ran rather swiftly,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:56.962" end="00:21:59.896"-->but not too strongly for even a moderate
swimmer.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:59.940" end="00:22:02.396"-->It will give you an idea, therefore,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:02.414" end="00:22:05.588"-->of the strange
deficiency in these creatures,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:05.588" end="00:22:10.642"-->when I tell you that none made the
slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying [little] thing<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:10.642" end="00:22:13.398"-->which
was drowning before their eyes.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:13.398" end="00:22:17.382"-->When I realized this, I hurriedly
slipped off my clothes,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:17.382" end="00:22:20.373"-->and, wading in at a point lower down,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:20.373" end="00:22:23.960"-->I
caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:24.004" end="00:22:27.243"-->A little rubbing of
the limbs soon brought her round,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:27.243" end="00:22:31.614"-->and I had the satisfaction of
seeing she was all right before I left her.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:31.653" end="00:22:35.179"-->I had got to such a low
estimate of her kind<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:35.179" end="00:22:38.113"-->that I did not expect any gratitude from her.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:22:38.236" end="00:22:40.953"-->In that, however, I was wrong.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:22:40.953" end="00:22:43.808"--><p>'This happened in the morning.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:43.983" end="00:22:48.254"-->In the afternoon I met my little
woman, as I believe it was,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:48.254" end="00:22:51.911"-->as I was returning towards my centre
from an exploration,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:51.911" end="00:22:54.693"-->and she received me with cries of delight<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:54.693" end="00:22:57.775"-->and
presented me with a big garland of flowers<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:22:57.775" end="00:23:00.997"-->— evidently made for me
and me alone.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:01.145" end="00:23:03.583"-->The thing took my imagination.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:03.583" end="00:23:07.248"-->Very possibly I had
been feeling desolate.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:07.266" end="00:23:12.268"-->At any rate I did my best to display my
appreciation of the gift.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:12.268" end="00:23:15.774"-->We were soon seated together in a little
stone arbour,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:15.774" end="00:23:17.694"-->engaged in conversation,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:17.694" end="00:23:19.784"-->chiefly of smiles.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:19.784" end="00:23:24.494"-->The
creature's friendliness affected me exactly as a child's might have
done.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:24.695" end="00:23:28.482"-->We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:28.482" end="00:23:30.507"-->I did
the same to hers.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:30.507" end="00:23:34.817"-->Then I tried talk, and found that her name was
Weena,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:34.817" end="00:23:37.220"-->which, though I don't know what it meant,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:37.220" end="00:23:39.676"-->somehow seemed
appropriate enough.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:39.676" end="00:23:43.908"-->That was the beginning of a queer friendship
which lasted a week,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:43.908" end="00:23:47.181"-->and ended — as I will tell you!<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:23:48.166" end="00:23:50.974"--><p>'She was exactly like a child.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:50.974" end="00:23:53.482"-->She wanted to be with me always.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:53.482" end="00:23:55.754"-->She
tried to follow me everywhere,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:23:55.754" end="00:23:58.223"-->and on my next journey out and about<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:23:58.223" end="00:24:01.227"-->it went to my heart to tire her down,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:01.227" end="00:24:06.224"-->and leave her at last,
exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:06.373" end="00:24:09.730"-->But the problems
of the world had to be mastered.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:09.730" end="00:24:12.473"-->I had not, I said to myself,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:12.473" end="00:24:16.268"-->come
into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:16.338" end="00:24:19.707"-->Yet her distress
when I left her was very great,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:19.707" end="00:24:23.913"-->her expostulations at the parting
were sometimes frantic,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:23.913" end="00:24:25.872"-->and I think, altogether,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:25.872" end="00:24:29.433"-->I had as much
trouble as comfort from her devotion.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:29.556" end="00:24:32.063"-->Nevertheless she was, somehow,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:24:32.063" end="00:24:34.114"-->a very great comfort.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:34.114" end="00:24:38.354"-->I thought it was mere childish affection that
made her cling to me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:38.739" end="00:24:42.187"-->Until it was too late, I did not clearly know<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:24:42.187" end="00:24:45.243"-->what I had inflicted upon her when I left her.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:45.243" end="00:24:50.920"-->Nor until it was too
late did I clearly understand what she was to me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:51.121" end="00:24:54.164"-->For, by merely
seeming fond of me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:54.164" end="00:24:58.344"-->and showing in her weak, futile way that she
cared for me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:24:58.344" end="00:25:03.738"-->the little doll of a creature presently gave my return
to the neighbourhood of the White Sphinx<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:03.738" end="00:25:06.206"-->almost the feeling of
coming home;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:06.205" end="00:25:09.955"-->and I would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:25:09.955" end="00:25:12.262"-->so soon as I came over the hill.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:25:12.776" end="00:25:18.375"--><p>'It was from her, too, that I learned that fear had not yet left the
world.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:18.628" end="00:25:21.371"-->She was fearless enough in the daylight,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:21.371" end="00:25:24.192"-->and she had the
oddest confidence in me;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:24.192" end="00:25:26.530"-->for once, in a foolish moment,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:26.530" end="00:25:28.815"-->I made
threatening grimaces at her,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:28.815" end="00:25:31.036"-->and she simply laughed at them.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:31.036" end="00:25:34.419"-->But she
dreaded the dark, dreaded shadows,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:34.419" end="00:25:36.417"-->dreaded black things.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:36.417" end="00:25:39.534"-->Darkness
to her was the one thing dreadful.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:39.865" end="00:25:42.686"-->It was a singularly passionate
emotion,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:42.686" end="00:25:45.181"-->and it set me thinking and observing.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:45.181" end="00:25:46.944"-->I discovered then,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:25:46.944" end="00:25:48.290"-->among other things,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:48.290" end="00:25:52.117"-->that these little people gathered into the great
houses after dark,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:52.117" end="00:25:54.180"-->and slept in droves.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:54.180" end="00:25:59.256"-->To enter upon them without a
light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:25:59.509" end="00:26:02.122"-->I never found
one out of doors,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:02.122" end="00:26:05.369"-->or one sleeping alone within doors, after dark.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:26:05.544" end="00:26:08.038"-->Yet I was still such a blockhead<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:08.038" end="00:26:10.559"-->that I missed the lesson of that
fear,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:10.559" end="00:26:12.975"-->and in spite of Weena's distress<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:12.975" end="00:26:17.581"-->I insisted upon sleeping away
from these slumbering multitudes.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:26:17.743" end="00:26:20.277"--><p>'It troubled her greatly,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:20.277" end="00:26:23.555"-->but in the end her odd affection for me
triumphed,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:23.555" end="00:26:28.505"-->and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including
the last night of all,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:28.505" end="00:26:31.544"-->she slept with her head pillowed on my arm.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:26:32.476" end="00:26:36.037"-->But my story slips away from me as I speak of her.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:36.081" end="00:26:40.939"-->It must have been
the night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:40.957" end="00:26:45.777"-->I had
been restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:45.777" end="00:26:50.688"-->and
that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:26:50.688" end="00:26:52.752"-->I woke with a start,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:52.752" end="00:26:54.959"-->and with an odd fancy that some<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:54.959" end="00:26:58.442"-->greyish animal
had just rushed out of the chamber.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:26:58.747" end="00:27:00.954"-->I tried to get to sleep again,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:27:00.954" end="00:27:03.705"-->but I felt restless and uncomfortable.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:03.802" end="00:27:08.673"-->It was that dim grey hour
when things are just creeping out of darkness,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:08.673" end="00:27:13.122"-->when everything is
colourless and clear cut, and yet unreal.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:13.384" end="00:27:16.649"-->I got up, and went down
into the great hall,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:16.649" end="00:27:20.528"-->and so out upon the flagstones in front of the
palace.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:20.528" end="00:27:25.264"-->I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the
sunrise.<!--/audio-->

of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:32.766" end="00:27:35.104"-->The bushes were inky
black,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:35.104" end="00:27:37.194"-->the ground a sombre grey,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:37.194" end="00:27:39.885"-->the sky colourless and cheerless.<!--/audio-->

as I scanned the slope,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:48.205" end="00:27:50.373"-->I saw white figures.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:50.373" end="00:27:53.952"-->Twice I fancied I saw
a solitary white,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:53.952" end="00:27:57.251"-->ape-like creature running rather quickly up the
hill,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:27:57.251" end="00:28:02.275"-->and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some
dark body.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:02.345" end="00:28:04.200"-->They moved hastily.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:04.200" end="00:28:06.716"-->I did not see what became of them.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:28:06.760" end="00:28:09.986"-->It seemed that they vanished among the bushes.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:09.986" end="00:28:13.473"-->The dawn was still
indistinct, you must understand.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:13.473" end="00:28:18.680"-->I was feeling that chill,
uncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:18.698" end="00:28:20.848"-->I doubted
my eyes.<!--/audio-->

the view keenly.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:31.594" end="00:28:34.846"-->But I saw no vestige of my white figures.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:34.846" end="00:28:37.519"-->They were
mere creatures of the half light.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:37.668" end="00:28:40.711"-->"They must have been ghosts," I
said;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:40.711" end="00:28:43.122"-->"I wonder whence they dated."<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:43.402" end="00:28:48.339"-->For a queer notion of Grant

them.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:28:56.123" end="00:29:01.491"-->On that theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight
Hundred Thousand Years hence,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:01.491" end="00:29:04.948"-->and it was no great wonder to see four
at once.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:05.148" end="00:29:08.061"-->But the jest was unsatisfying,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:08.061" end="00:29:11.091"-->and I was thinking of these
figures all the morning,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:11.091" end="00:29:14.339"-->until Weena's rescue drove them out of my
head.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:14.461" end="00:29:18.954"-->I associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal<!--/audio-->

was hotter,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:43.431" end="00:29:45.581"-->or the earth nearer the sun.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:29:45.677" end="00:29:50.884"-->It is usual to assume that

with renewed energy;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:07.228" end="00:30:11.251"-->and it may be that some inner planet had
suffered this fate.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:11.251" end="00:30:16.797"-->Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the
sun was very much hotter than we know it.<!--/audio-->

shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great
house where I slept and fed,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:28.335" end="00:30:30.726"-->there happened this strange thing:<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:30:35.597" end="00:30:40.255"-->whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:30:40.430" end="00:30:43.499"-->By contrast with the brilliancy outside,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:43.499" end="00:30:46.765"-->it seemed at first
impenetrably dark to me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:46.765" end="00:30:48.633"-->I entered it groping,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:48.633" end="00:30:53.369"-->for the change from
light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:53.517" end="00:30:56.417"-->Suddenly I
halted spellbound.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:30:56.417" end="00:31:01.197"-->A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection against
the daylight without,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:01.197" end="00:31:04.157"-->was watching me out of the darkness.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:31:04.306" end="00:31:08.499"--><p>'The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:08.499" end="00:31:13.292"-->I clenched
my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:13.292" end="00:31:15.286"-->I was
afraid to turn.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:15.304" end="00:31:21.821"-->Then the thought of the absolute security in which
humanity appeared to be living came to my mind.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:21.821" end="00:31:25.439"-->And then I
remembered that strange terror of the dark.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:25.875" end="00:31:28.722"-->Overcoming my fear to
some extent,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:28.722" end="00:31:31.473"-->I advanced a step and spoke.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:31.544" end="00:31:35.470"-->I will admit that my
voice was harsh and ill-controlled.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:35.540" end="00:31:39.015"-->I put out my hand and touched
something soft.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:39.015" end="00:31:41.739"-->At once the eyes darted sideways,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:41.739" end="00:31:44.203"-->and something
white ran past me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:44.247" end="00:31:49.197"-->I turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw a
queer little ape-like figure,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:49.197" end="00:31:52.045"-->its head held down in a peculiar
manner,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:52.045" end="00:31:55.162"-->running across the sunlit space behind me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:55.166" end="00:31:57.779"-->It blundered
against a block of granite,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:57.779" end="00:31:59.398"-->staggered aside,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:31:59.398" end="00:32:04.735"-->and in a moment was
hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:32:05.511" end="00:32:09.116"--><p>'My impression of it is, of course, imperfect;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:09.116" end="00:32:11.349"-->but I know it was a
dull white,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:11.349" end="00:32:14.680"-->and had strange large greyish-red eyes;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:14.680" end="00:32:19.003"-->also that there
was flaxen hair on its head and down its back.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:19.003" end="00:32:20.936"-->But, as I say,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:20.936" end="00:32:23.953"-->it
went too fast for me to see distinctly.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:23.953" end="00:32:27.441"-->I cannot even say whether it
ran on all-fours,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:27.441" end="00:32:30.557"-->or only with its forearms held very low.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:30.889" end="00:32:35.695"-->After an
instant's pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:35.695" end="00:32:37.968"-->I could
not find it at first;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:37.968" end="00:32:41.259"-->but, after a time in the profound obscurity,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:41.259" end="00:32:46.432"-->I
came upon one of those round well-like openings of which I have told
you,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:46.432" end="00:32:48.974"-->half closed by a fallen pillar.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:49.436" end="00:32:51.787"-->A sudden thought came to me.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:32:51.787" end="00:32:55.339"-->Could this Thing have vanished down the shaft?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:55.339" end="00:32:56.946"-->I lit a match,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:32:56.946" end="00:33:00.838"-->and,
looking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:00.838" end="00:33:05.731"-->with large
bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:06.037" end="00:33:07.787"-->It made
me shudder.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:07.787" end="00:33:10.321"-->It was so like a human spider!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:10.321" end="00:33:14.631"-->It was clambering down
the wall, and now I saw for the first time<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:14.631" end="00:33:17.374"-->a number of metal foot
and hand rests<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:17.374" end="00:33:20.299"-->forming a kind of ladder down the shaft.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:20.299" end="00:33:23.826"-->Then the
light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:23.826" end="00:33:25.707"-->going out as it
dropped,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:25.707" end="00:33:27.483"-->and when I had lit another<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:27.483" end="00:33:29.868"-->the little monster had
disappeared.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:33:31.062" end="00:33:34.727"--><p>'I do not know how long I sat peering down that well.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:34.771" end="00:33:41.022"-->It was not for
some time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I
had seen was human.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:41.301" end="00:33:44.619"-->But, gradually, the truth dawned on me:<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:44.619" end="00:33:47.858"-->that
Man had not remained one species,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:47.858" end="00:33:51.607"-->but had differentiated into two
distinct animals:<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:51.607" end="00:33:57.223"-->that my graceful children of the Upper-world were
not the sole descendants of our generation,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:33:57.223" end="00:34:01.246"-->but that this bleached,
obscene, nocturnal Thing,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:01.246" end="00:34:03.179"-->which had flashed before me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:03.179" end="00:34:06.348"-->was also heir
to all the ages.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:34:06.615" end="00:34:09.201"--><p>'I thought of the flickering pillars<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:09.201" end="00:34:12.239"-->and of my theory of an
underground ventilation.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:12.362" end="00:34:15.548"-->I began to suspect their true import.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:15.548" end="00:34:17.455"-->And
what, I wondered,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:17.455" end="00:34:22.322"-->was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly
balanced organization?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:22.340" end="00:34:27.761"-->How was it related to the indolent serenity
of the beautiful Upper-worlders?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:27.761" end="00:34:29.942"-->And what was hidden down there,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:34:29.942" end="00:34:32.301"-->at the foot of that shaft?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:32.580" end="00:34:36.616"-->I sat upon the edge of the well telling
myself that,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:36.616" end="00:34:39.398"-->at any rate, there was nothing to fear,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:39.398" end="00:34:43.539"-->and that there
I must descend for the solution of my difficulties.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:43.539" end="00:34:47.439"-->And withal I
was absolutely afraid to go!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:47.653" end="00:34:49.351"-->As I hesitated,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:49.351" end="00:34:53.557"-->two of the beautiful
Upper-world people came running in their amorous sport<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:53.557" end="00:34:55.785"-->across the
daylight in the shadow.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:55.803" end="00:34:58.206"-->The male pursued the female,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:34:58.206" end="00:35:00.748"-->flinging
flowers at her as he ran.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:35:01.054" end="00:35:03.535"--><p>'They seemed distressed to find me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:03.535" end="00:35:06.043"-->my arm against the overturned
pillar,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:06.043" end="00:35:07.619"-->peering down the well.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:07.819" end="00:35:12.247"-->Apparently it was considered bad form
to remark these apertures;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:12.247" end="00:35:14.141"-->for when I pointed to this one,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:14.141" end="00:35:17.524"-->and tried
to frame a question about it in their tongue,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:17.524" end="00:35:21.242"-->they were still more
visibly distressed and turned away.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:21.351" end="00:35:24.120"-->But they were interested by my
matches,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:24.120" end="00:35:26.427"-->and I struck some to amuse them.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:26.471" end="00:35:29.018"-->I tried them again about
the well,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:29.018" end="00:35:30.742"-->and again I failed.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:30.742" end="00:35:33.002"-->So presently I left them,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:33.002" end="00:35:35.039"-->meaning to
go back to Weena,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:35.039" end="00:35:37.320"-->and see what I could get from her.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:37.338" end="00:35:40.655"-->But my mind was
already in revolution;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:40.655" end="00:35:45.470"-->my guesses and impressions were slipping and
sliding to a new adjustment.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:45.514" end="00:35:49.067"-->I had now a clue to the import of these
wells,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:49.067" end="00:35:51.052"-->to the ventilating towers,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:51.052" end="00:35:53.181"-->to the mystery of the ghosts;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:53.181" end="00:35:57.086"-->to

fate of the Time Machine!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:35:58.993" end="00:36:06.099"-->And very vaguely there came a suggestion

the bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the
dark<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:30.876" end="00:36:34.363"-->— the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for example.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:35.173" end="00:36:37.419"-->Then,
those large eyes,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:37.419" end="00:36:40.123"-->with that capacity for reflecting light,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:40.123" end="00:36:43.036"-->are
common features of nocturnal things<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:43.036" end="00:36:45.465"-->— witness the owl and the cat.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:36:45.465" end="00:36:47.137"-->And last of all,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:47.137" end="00:36:49.671"-->that evident confusion in the sunshine,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:49.671" end="00:36:54.399"-->that hasty
yet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:54.399" end="00:36:57.978"-->and that peculiar
carriage of the head while in the light<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:36:57.978" end="00:37:02.871"-->— all reinforced the theory
of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:37:03.594" end="00:37:05.579"--><p>'Beneath my feet, then,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:05.579" end="00:37:08.244"-->the earth must be tunnelled enormously,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:08.244" end="00:37:12.123"-->and
these tunnellings were the habitat of the new race.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:12.123" end="00:37:16.629"-->The presence of
ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:16.629" end="00:37:20.130"-->— everywhere, in
fact, except along the river valley<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:20.130" end="00:37:23.821"-->— showed how universal were its
ramifications.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:24.048" end="00:37:29.468"-->What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in
this artificial Underworld<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:29.468" end="00:37:34.440"-->that such work as was necessary to the
comfort of the daylight race was done?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:34.954" end="00:37:38.846"-->The notion was so plausible
that I at once accepted it,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:38.846" end="00:37:43.452"-->and went on to assume the <i>how</i> of this
splitting of the human species.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:43.810" end="00:37:47.597"-->I dare say you will anticipate the
shape of my theory;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:47.597" end="00:37:49.439"-->though, for myself,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:49.439" end="00:37:53.575"-->I very soon felt that it
fell far short of the truth.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:37:53.697" end="00:37:57.537"--><p>'At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:37:57.537" end="00:38:04.864"-->it seemed
clear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present
merely temporary and social difference<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:04.864" end="00:38:07.333"-->between the Capitalist and
the Labourer,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:07.333" end="00:38:09.849"-->was the key to the whole position.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:09.971" end="00:38:12.975"-->No doubt it will
seem grotesque enough to you<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:12.975" end="00:38:14.843"-->— and wildly incredible!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:14.843" end="00:38:16.633"-->— and yet even
now<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:16.633" end="00:38:19.976"-->there are existing circumstances to point that way.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:19.976" end="00:38:23.477"-->There is
a tendency to utilize underground space<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:23.477" end="00:38:27.055"-->for the less ornamental
purposes of civilization;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:27.055" end="00:38:31.104"-->there is the Metropolitan Railway in
London, for instance,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:31.104" end="00:38:33.168"-->there are new electric railways,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:33.168" end="00:38:37.452"-->there are
subways, there are underground workrooms and restaurants,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:37.452" end="00:38:39.811"-->and they
increase and multiply.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:39.811" end="00:38:41.993"-->Evidently, I thought,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:41.993" end="00:38:47.878"-->this tendency had
increased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in the
sky.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:48.001" end="00:38:54.296"-->I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever
larger underground factories,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:54.296" end="00:38:58.058"-->spending a still-increasing amount of
its time therein,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:38:58.058" end="00:39:00.208"-->till, in the end<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:00.440" end="00:39:06.291"-->— ! Even now, does not an East-end
worker live in such artificial conditions<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:06.291" end="00:39:10.557"-->as practically to be cut
off from the natural surface of the earth?<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:39:11.411" end="00:39:15.460"--><p>'Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:15.460" end="00:39:16.988"-->— due, no doubt,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:16.988" end="00:39:20.045"-->to
the increasing refinement of their education,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:20.045" end="00:39:24.285"-->and the widening gulf
between them and the rude violence of the poor<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:24.329" end="00:39:26.941"-->— is already leading
to the closing,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:26.941" end="00:39:28.417"-->in their interest,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:28.417" end="00:39:31.847"-->of considerable portions of the
surface of the land.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:32.048" end="00:39:38.535"-->About London, for instance, perhaps half the
prettier country is shut in against intrusion.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:38.535" end="00:39:40.964"-->And this same
widening gulf<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:40.964" end="00:39:45.509"-->— which is due to the length and expense of the higher
educational process<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:45.509" end="00:39:47.722"-->and the increased facilities for<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:47.722" end="00:39:52.345"-->and temptations
towards refined habits on the part of the rich<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:52.345" end="00:39:55.637"-->— will make that
exchange between class and class,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:39:55.637" end="00:39:58.406"-->that promotion by intermarriage<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:39:58.406" end="00:40:01.632"-->which at present retards the splitting of our species<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:01.632" end="00:40:04.479"-->along lines
of social stratification,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:04.479" end="00:40:06.582"-->less and less frequent.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:06.582" end="00:40:11.219"-->So, in the end,
above ground you must have the Haves,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:11.219" end="00:40:14.001"-->pursuing pleasure and comfort
and beauty,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:14.001" end="00:40:16.953"-->and below ground the Have-nots,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:16.953" end="00:40:22.133"-->the Workers getting
continually adapted to the conditions of their labour.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:22.255" end="00:40:25.860"-->Once they
were there, they would no doubt have to pay rent,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:25.860" end="00:40:27.637"-->and not a little
of it,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:27.637" end="00:40:29.922"-->for the ventilation of their caverns;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:29.922" end="00:40:35.016"-->and if they refused,
they would starve or be suffocated for arrears.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:35.016" end="00:40:40.541"-->Such of them as were
so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:40.541" end="00:40:43.937"-->and, in
the end, the balance being permanent,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:43.937" end="00:40:48.613"-->the survivors would become as
well adapted to the conditions of underground life,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:48.613" end="00:40:50.624"-->and as happy in
their way,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:50.624" end="00:40:53.785"-->as the Upper-world people were to theirs.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:53.785" end="00:40:58.748"-->As it seemed to
me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:40:58.748" end="00:41:00.873"-->followed naturally
enough.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:41:01.361" end="00:41:04.731"--><p>'The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:04.731" end="00:41:07.082"-->took a different
shape in my mind.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:07.082" end="00:41:13.699"-->It had been no such triumph of moral education and
general co-operation as I had imagined.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:14.056" end="00:41:17.282"-->Instead, I saw a real
aristocracy,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:17.282" end="00:41:21.854"-->armed with a perfected science and working to a logical
conclusion<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:21.854" end="00:41:24.317"-->the industrial system of to-day.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:24.492" end="00:41:28.515"-->Its triumph had not been
simply a triumph over Nature,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:28.515" end="00:41:31.658"-->but a triumph over Nature and the
fellow-man.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:31.911" end="00:41:35.372"-->This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:35.372" end="00:41:40.218"-->I had
no convenient cicerone in the pattern of the Utopian books.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:40.218" end="00:41:43.700"-->My
explanation may be absolutely wrong.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:43.718" end="00:41:47.122"-->I still think it is the
most plausible one.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:47.140" end="00:41:53.044"-->But even on this supposition the balanced
civilization that was at last attained<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:53.044" end="00:41:55.957"-->must have long since passed
its zenith,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:55.957" end="00:41:59.287"-->and was now far fallen into decay.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:41:59.286" end="00:42:02.409"-->The too-perfect
security of the Upper-worlders<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:02.409" end="00:42:05.700"-->had led them to a slow movement of
degeneration,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:05.700" end="00:42:10.337"-->to a general dwindling in size, strength, and
intelligence.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:10.337" end="00:42:13.297"-->That I could see clearly enough already.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:13.341" end="00:42:17.547"-->What had
happened to the Under-grounders I did not yet suspect;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:17.547" end="00:42:20.251"-->but from what
I had seen of the Morlocks<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:20.251" end="00:42:24.517"-->— that, by the by, was the name by which
these creatures were called<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:24.561" end="00:42:30.099"-->— I could imagine that the modification
of the human type was even far more profound<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:30.099" end="00:42:32.162"-->than among the "Eloi,"<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:42:32.162" end="00:42:34.652"-->the beautiful race that I already knew.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:42:35.271" end="00:42:37.988"--><p>'Then came troublesome doubts.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:37.988" end="00:42:41.078"-->Why had the Morlocks taken my Time
Machine?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:41.148" end="00:42:44.500"-->For I felt sure it was they who had taken it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:44.544" end="00:42:47.757"-->Why, too, if
the Eloi were masters,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:47.757" end="00:42:50.482"-->could they not restore the machine to me?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:50.482" end="00:42:54.140"-->And
why were they so terribly afraid of the dark?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:54.140" end="00:42:56.647"-->I proceeded, as I have
said,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:56.647" end="00:42:59.669"-->to question Weena about this Under-world,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:42:59.669" end="00:43:02.125"-->but here again I was
disappointed.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:02.125" end="00:43:06.069"-->At first she would not understand my questions,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:06.069" end="00:43:08.925"-->and
presently she refused to answer them.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:09.204" end="00:43:12.835"-->She shivered as though the
topic was unendurable.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:12.853" end="00:43:14.577"-->And when I pressed her,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:14.577" end="00:43:16.458"-->perhaps a little
harshly,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:16.458" end="00:43:18.639"-->she burst into tears.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:18.639" end="00:43:21.722"-->They were the only tears, except my
own,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:21.722" end="00:43:24.491"-->I ever saw in that Golden Age.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:24.491" end="00:43:28.613"-->When I saw them I ceased
abruptly to trouble about the Morlocks,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:28.613" end="00:43:34.569"-->and was only concerned in
banishing these signs of the human inheritance from Weena's eyes.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:43:34.569" end="00:43:38.056"-->And very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:43:38.056" end="00:43:40.781"-->while I
solemnly burned a match.<!--/audio-->
