real body must have extension in <i>four</i> directions:<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:47.118" end="00:02:52.564"-->it must have
Length, Breadth, Thickness, and — Duration.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:52.564" end="00:02:57.658"-->But through a natural
infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:57.658" end="00:03:00.558"-->we
incline to overlook this fact.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:00.558" end="00:03:02.726"-->There are really four dimensions,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:03:02.726" end="00:03:05.521"-->three which we call the three planes of Space,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:05.521" end="00:03:07.567"-->and a fourth, Time.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:03:08.029" end="00:03:14.938"-->There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between
the former three dimensions and the latter,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:14.938" end="00:03:20.228"-->because it happens that
our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the
latter<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:20.228" end="00:03:22.875"-->from the beginning to the end of our lives.'<!--/audio-->

his cigar over the lamp;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:30.146" end="00:03:34.125"-->'that … very clear indeed.'<!--/audio-->

cheerfulness.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:44.391" end="00:03:47.448"-->'Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:03:47.448" end="00:03:51.797"-->though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know
they mean it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:51.797" end="00:03:54.809"-->It is only another way of looking at Time.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:54.880" end="00:03:57.675"--><i>There is

people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:07.927" end="00:04:12.219"-->You have all
heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:04:17.069" end="00:04:18.924"--><p>'It is simply this.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:18.924" end="00:04:22.020"-->That Space, as our mathematicians have it,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:22.020" end="00:04:24.620"-->is
spoken of as having three dimensions,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:24.620" end="00:04:28.081"-->which one may call Length,
Breadth, and Thickness,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:28.081" end="00:04:31.568"-->and is always definable by reference to
three planes,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:31.568" end="00:04:34.285"-->each at right angles to the others.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:34.285" end="00:04:39.745"-->But some
philosophical people have been asking why <i>three</i> dimensions
particularly<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:39.745" end="00:04:43.728"-->— why not another direction at right angles to the other
three?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:43.728" end="00:04:47.707"-->— and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimension geometry.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:04:47.830" end="00:04:54.630"-->Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York
Mathematical Society only a month or so ago.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:54.857" end="00:04:57.312"-->You know how on a flat
surface,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:57.312" end="00:04:59.206"-->which has only two dimensions,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:59.206" end="00:05:02.654"-->we can represent a figure of
a three-dimensional solid,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:02.654" end="00:05:06.233"-->and similarly they think that by models
of three dimensions<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:06.233" end="00:05:08.514"-->they could represent one of four<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:08.688" end="00:05:12.171"-->— if they could
master the perspective of the thing. See?'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:05:12.894" end="00:05:14.919"--><p>'I think so,'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:14.919" end="00:05:17.008"-->murmured the Provincial Mayor;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:17.008" end="00:05:21.423"-->and, knitting his
brows, he lapsed into an introspective state,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:21.423" end="00:05:25.010"-->his lips moving as one
who repeats mystic words.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:25.342" end="00:05:28.641"-->'Yes, I think I see it now,'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:28.646" end="00:05:30.736"-->he said after
some time,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:30.736" end="00:05:33.113"-->brightening in a quite transitory manner.<!--/audio-->

it fell,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:29.564" end="00:06:33.908"-->then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to
here.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:33.952" end="00:06:40.169"-->Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the

such a line,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:42.991" end="00:06:47.231"-->and that line, therefore, we must conclude was along

course we have no means of staying back for any length of Time,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:06.063" end="00:09:11.008"-->any
more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the

and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:58.928" end="00:12:00.927"-->he walked slowly
out of the room,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:00.927" end="00:12:05.454"-->and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long
passage to his laboratory.<!--/audio-->

Filby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at Burslem;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:20.323" end="00:12:24.319"-->but
before he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:24.319" end="00:12:26.940"-->and
Filby's anecdote collapsed.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:12:27.415" end="00:12:32.378"--><p>The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering
metallic framework,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:32.378" end="00:12:34.808"-->scarcely larger than a small clock,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:34.808" end="00:12:37.054"-->and very
delicately made.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:37.054" end="00:12:41.573"-->There was ivory in it, and some transparent
crystalline substance.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:41.573" end="00:12:44.159"-->And now I must be explicit,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:44.159" end="00:12:45.910"-->for this that
follows<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:45.910" end="00:12:48.940"-->— unless his explanation is to be accepted<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:48.940" end="00:12:52.370"-->— is an absolutely
unaccountable thing.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:52.545" end="00:12:57.182"-->He took one of the small octagonal tables that
were scattered about the room,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:57.182" end="00:12:59.206"-->and set it in front of the fire,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:59.206" end="00:13:01.413"-->with
two legs on the hearthrug.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:01.413" end="00:13:04.300"-->On this table he placed the mechanism.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:13:04.300" end="00:13:07.469"-->Then he drew up a chair, and sat down.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:07.670" end="00:13:11.601"-->The only other object on the
table was a small shaded lamp,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:11.601" end="00:13:14.326"-->the bright light of which fell upon
the model.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:14.553" end="00:13:17.544"-->There were also perhaps a dozen candles about,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:17.544" end="00:13:21.737"-->two in
brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:21.737" end="00:13:24.357"-->so that
the room was brilliantly illuminated.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:24.532" end="00:13:32.721"-->I sat in a low arm-chair
nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between
the Time Traveller and the fireplace.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:32.721" end="00:13:34.628"-->Filby sat behind him,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:34.628" end="00:13:36.457"-->looking
over his shoulder.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:36.457" end="00:13:41.054"-->The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched
him in profile from the right,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:41.054" end="00:13:43.288"-->the Psychologist from the left.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:43.288" end="00:13:46.553"-->The
Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:46.553" end="00:13:48.760"-->We were all on the
alert.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:48.778" end="00:13:52.226"-->It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:52.226" end="00:13:56.171"-->however
subtly conceived and however adroitly done,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:56.171" end="00:13:59.497"-->could have been played
upon us under these conditions.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:13:59.758" end="00:14:02.213"--><p>The Time Traveller looked at us,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:02.213" end="00:14:04.024"-->and then at the mechanism.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:04.068" end="00:14:07.229"-->'Well?'
said the Psychologist.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:14:08.013" end="00:14:09.684"--><p>'This little affair,'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:09.684" end="00:14:13.577"-->said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows
upon the table<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:13.577" end="00:14:16.850"-->and pressing his hands together above the apparatus,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:14:16.850" end="00:14:18.639"-->'is only a model.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:18.657" end="00:14:22.584"-->It is my plan for a machine to travel through
time.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:22.758" end="00:14:29.485"-->You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there
is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:29.485" end="00:14:32.628"-->as though it was in
some way unreal.'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:32.855" end="00:14:35.370"-->He pointed to the part with his finger.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:35.370" end="00:14:38.759"-->'Also,
here is one little white lever,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:38.759" end="00:14:40.648"-->and here is another.'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:14:41.293" end="00:14:45.472"--><p>The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:14:45.472" end="00:14:48.693"-->'It's beautifully made,' he said.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:14:49.051" end="00:14:53.239"--><p>'It took two years to make,' retorted the Time Traveller.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:53.387" end="00:14:57.941"-->Then, when
we had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said:<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:58.220" end="00:15:03.000"-->'Now I
want you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:15:03.000" end="00:15:06.279"-->sends the machine gliding into the future,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:06.279" end="00:15:08.899"-->and this other reverses
the motion.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:09.100" end="00:15:12.687"-->This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller.<!--/audio-->

go.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:17.786" end="00:15:22.365"-->It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:22.435" end="00:15:24.656"-->Have a
good look at the thing.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:24.656" end="00:15:29.131"-->Look at the table too, and satisfy
yourselves there is no trickery.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:29.175" end="00:15:31.631"-->I don't want to waste this model,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:15:31.631" end="00:15:33.807"-->and then be told I'm a quack.'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:15:34.765" end="00:15:37.482"--><p>There was a minute's pause perhaps.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:37.482" end="00:15:41.904"-->The Psychologist seemed about to
speak to me, but changed his mind.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:42.001" end="00:15:45.823"-->Then the Time Traveller put forth
his finger towards the lever.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:46.076" end="00:15:48.897"-->'No,' he said suddenly.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:48.897" end="00:15:50.891"-->'Lend me your
hand.'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:50.909" end="00:15:55.533"-->And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual's
hand in his own<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:55.533" end="00:15:57.970"-->and told him to put out his forefinger.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:57.988" end="00:16:03.173"-->So that it
was the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine<!--/audio-->

absolutely certain there was no trickery.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:12.120" end="00:16:13.975"-->There was a breath of
wind,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:13.975" end="00:16:16.169"-->and the lamp flame jumped.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:16.169" end="00:16:18.808"-->One of the candles on the mantel
was blown out,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:18.808" end="00:16:21.524"-->and the little machine suddenly swung round,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:21.524" end="00:16:23.301"-->became
indistinct,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:23.301" end="00:16:26.122"-->was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:26.122" end="00:16:29.949"-->as an eddy of
faintly glittering brass and ivory;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:29.949" end="00:16:31.673"-->and it was gone<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:31.673" end="00:16:33.018"-->— vanished!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:33.018" end="00:16:36.213"-->Save

under the table.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:48.914" end="00:16:52.257"-->At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:16:52.257" end="00:16:56.933"-->'Well?' he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:56.933" end="00:17:00.969"-->Then,
getting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:00.969" end="00:17:03.982"-->and with his
back to us began to fill his pipe.<!--/audio-->

in earnest about this?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:12.319" end="00:17:17.056"-->Do you seriously believe that that machine

<!--audio start="00:17:59.144" end="00:18:02.888"--><p>After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:03.271" end="00:18:08.217"-->'It must have
gone into the past if it has gone anywhere,' he said.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:18:08.626" end="00:18:11.221"--><p>'Why?' said the Time Traveller.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:18:11.787" end="00:18:15.758"--><p>'Because I presume that it has not moved in space,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:15.758" end="00:18:20.434"-->and if it
travelled into the future it would still be here all this time,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:18:20.434" end="00:18:23.263"-->since it must have travelled through this time.'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:18:23.908" end="00:18:26.181"--><p>'But,' I said,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:26.181" end="00:18:31.405"-->'If it travelled into the past it would have been
visible when we came first into this room;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:31.405" end="00:18:33.835"-->and last Thursday when we
were here;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:33.835" end="00:18:36.977"-->and the Thursday before that; and so forth!'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:18:37.701" end="00:18:41.606"--><p>'Serious objections,' remarked the Provincial Mayor,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:41.606" end="00:18:46.081"-->with an air of
impartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:18:46.282" end="00:18:48.097"--><p>'Not a bit,'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:48.097" end="00:18:49.704"-->said the Time Traveller,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:49.704" end="00:18:51.663"-->and, to the Psychologist:<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:51.663" end="00:18:53.191"-->'You
think.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:53.191" end="00:18:55.425"-->You can explain that.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:55.425" end="00:18:57.946"-->It's presentation below the threshold,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:18:57.946" end="00:19:00.566"-->you know, diluted presentation.'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:19:01.159" end="00:19:06.017"--><p>'Of course,' said the Psychologist, and reassured us.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:06.017" end="00:19:08.604"-->'That's a
simple point of psychology.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:08.604" end="00:19:10.132"-->I should have thought of it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:10.132" end="00:19:13.724"-->It's plain
enough, and helps the paradox delightfully.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:13.724" end="00:19:15.239"-->We cannot see it,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:15.239" end="00:19:17.746"-->nor
can we appreciate this machine,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:17.746" end="00:19:20.946"-->any more than we can the spoke of
a wheel spinning,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:20.946" end="00:19:23.062"-->or a bullet flying through the air.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:23.062" end="00:19:28.587"-->If it is
travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than
we are,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:28.587" end="00:19:31.683"-->if it gets through a minute while we get through a second,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:19:31.683" end="00:19:37.626"-->the impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or
one-hundredth of what it would make<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:37.626" end="00:19:40.016"-->if it were not travelling in
time.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:40.016" end="00:19:42.140"-->That's plain enough.'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:42.288" end="00:19:46.084"-->He passed his hand through the space in
which the machine had been.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:46.181" end="00:19:49.324"-->'You see?' he said, laughing.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:19:50.073" end="00:19:54.448"--><p>We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:19:54.448" end="00:19:57.879"-->Then the
Time Traveller asked us what we thought of it all.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:19:58.576" end="00:20:01.645"--><p>'It sounds plausible enough to-night,'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:01.645" end="00:20:03.213"-->said the Medical Man;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:03.213" end="00:20:05.002"-->'but
wait until to-morrow.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:05.002" end="00:20:07.701"-->Wait for the common sense of the morning.'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:20:08.764" end="00:20:11.872"--><p>'Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:11.872" end="00:20:13.740"-->asked the Time
Traveller.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:13.740" end="00:20:16.835"-->And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:16.835" end="00:20:20.945"-->he led the
way down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:20.963" end="00:20:24.111"-->I remember
vividly the flickering light,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:24.111" end="00:20:26.893"-->his queer, broad head in silhouette,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:20:26.893" end="00:20:28.826"-->the dance of the shadows,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:28.826" end="00:20:30.550"-->how we all followed him,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:30.550" end="00:20:32.457"-->puzzled but
incredulous,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:32.457" end="00:20:37.799"-->and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger
edition of the little mechanism<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:37.799" end="00:20:41.064"-->which we had seen vanish from before
our eyes.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:41.064" end="00:20:44.212"-->Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:44.212" end="00:20:48.399"-->parts had certainly
been filed or sawn out of rock crystal.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:48.417" end="00:20:50.612"-->The thing was generally
complete,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:50.612" end="00:20:54.295"-->but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the
bench<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:54.295" end="00:20:56.359"-->beside some sheets of drawings,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:56.359" end="00:20:58.997"-->and I took one up for a better
look at it.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:20:58.997" end="00:21:01.043"-->Quartz it seemed to be.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:21:01.505" end="00:21:04.496"--><p>'Look here,' said the Medical Man,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:04.496" end="00:21:06.834"-->'are you perfectly serious?<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:21:06.834" end="00:21:08.832"-->Or is this a trick<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:08.832" end="00:21:12.053"-->— like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:21:12.411" end="00:21:14.475"--><p>'Upon that machine,'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:14.475" end="00:21:17.453"-->said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp
aloft,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:17.453" end="00:21:20.386"-->'I intend to explore time.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:20.431" end="00:21:22.089"-->Is that plain?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:21:22.089" end="00:21:24.997"-->I was never more
serious in my life.'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:21:25.642" end="00:21:28.654"--><p>None of us quite knew how to take it.<!--/audio-->

winked at me solemnly.<!--/audio-->
