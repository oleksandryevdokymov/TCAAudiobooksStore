<!--audio start="00:00:19.200" end="00:00:22.439"--><p>'In another moment we were standing face to face,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:22.439" end="00:00:25.495"-->I and this fragile
thing out of futurity.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:25.495" end="00:00:28.943"-->He came straight up to me and laughed into my
eyes.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:28.943" end="00:00:33.266"-->The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at
once.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:33.266" end="00:00:36.427"-->Then he turned to the two others who were following him<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:36.427" end="00:00:40.824"-->and
spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:00:41.129" end="00:00:42.736"--><p>'There were others coming,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:42.736" end="00:00:48.783"-->and presently a little group of perhaps
eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:48.783" end="00:00:50.625"-->One of them
addressed me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:50.625" end="00:00:53.472"-->It came into my head, oddly enough,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:53.472" end="00:00:56.737"-->that my voice was
too harsh and deep for them.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:56.737" end="00:01:01.422"-->So I shook my head, and, pointing to my
ears, shook it again.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:01.570" end="00:01:03.464"-->He came a step forward,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:03.464" end="00:01:06.659"-->hesitated, and then
touched my hand.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:06.755" end="00:01:11.484"-->Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my
back and shoulders.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:11.484" end="00:01:14.096"-->They wanted to make sure I was real.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:14.096" end="00:01:16.995"-->There was
nothing in this at all alarming.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:16.995" end="00:01:21.893"-->Indeed, there was something in
these pretty little people that inspired confidence<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:21.893" end="00:01:23.853"-->— a graceful
gentleness,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:23.853" end="00:01:26.230"-->a certain childlike ease.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:26.230" end="00:01:30.266"-->And besides, they looked so
frail that I could fancy myself<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:30.266" end="00:01:34.106"-->flinging the whole dozen of them
about like nine-pins.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:34.106" end="00:01:36.679"-->But I made a sudden motion to warn them<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:36.679" end="00:01:40.475"-->when I
saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:40.571" end="00:01:42.034"-->Happily
then,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:42.034" end="00:01:43.627"-->when it was not too late,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:43.627" end="00:01:46.736"-->I thought of a danger I had hitherto
forgotten,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:46.736" end="00:01:52.561"-->and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the
little levers that would set it in motion,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:52.561" end="00:01:54.711"-->and put these in my
pocket.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:54.912" end="00:01:59.100"-->Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of
communication.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:01:59.484" end="00:02:03.128"--><p>'And then, looking more nearly into their features,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:03.128" end="00:02:08.483"-->I saw some
further peculiarities in their Dresden-china type of prettiness.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:02:08.483" end="00:02:11.552"-->Their hair, which was uniformly curly,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:11.552" end="00:02:14.452"-->came to a sharp end at the
neck and cheek;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:14.452" end="00:02:17.730"-->there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the
face,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:17.730" end="00:02:20.951"-->and their ears were singularly minute.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:21.048" end="00:02:22.863"-->The mouths were small,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:02:22.863" end="00:02:25.815"-->with bright red, rather thin lips,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:25.815" end="00:02:28.488"-->and the little chins ran to a
point.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:28.558" end="00:02:30.896"-->The eyes were large and mild;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:30.896" end="00:02:34.579"-->and — this may seem egotism on
my part<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:34.579" end="00:02:40.204"-->— I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the
interest I might have expected in them.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:02:40.927" end="00:02:44.244"--><p>'As they made no effort to communicate with me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:44.244" end="00:02:49.782"-->but simply stood
round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:49.782" end="00:02:51.990"-->I
began the conversation.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:51.990" end="00:02:55.399"-->I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:02:55.399" end="00:02:59.644"-->Then hesitating for a moment how to express time,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:59.644" end="00:03:01.506"-->I pointed to the
sun.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:01.681" end="00:03:07.454"-->At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and
white followed my gesture,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:07.454" end="00:03:11.041"-->and then astonished me by imitating the
sound of thunder.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:03:11.660" end="00:03:13.972"--><p>'For a moment I was staggered,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:13.972" end="00:03:17.041"-->though the import of his gesture was
plain enough.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:17.041" end="00:03:19.993"-->The question had come into my mind abruptly:<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:19.993" end="00:03:22.404"-->were
these creatures fools?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:22.422" end="00:03:25.461"-->You may hardly understand how it took me.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:03:25.635" end="00:03:32.218"-->You see I had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight
Hundred and Two Thousand odd<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:32.218" end="00:03:37.268"-->would be incredibly in front of us in
knowledge, art, everything.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:37.573" end="00:03:43.007"-->Then one of them suddenly asked me a
question that showed him to be on the intellectual level<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:43.007" end="00:03:44.992"-->of one of
our five-year-old children<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:44.992" end="00:03:49.989"-->— asked me, in fact, if I had come from
the sun in a thunderstorm!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:50.164" end="00:03:54.174"-->It let loose the judgment I had suspended
upon their clothes,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:54.174" end="00:03:57.596"-->their frail light limbs, and fragile features.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:03:57.596" end="00:04:01.175"-->A flow of disappointment rushed across my mind.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:01.175" end="00:04:05.415"-->For a moment I felt
that I had built the Time Machine in vain.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:04:05.877" end="00:04:07.353"--><p>'I nodded,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:07.353" end="00:04:08.802"-->pointed to the sun,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:08.920" end="00:04:13.126"-->and gave them such a vivid rendering
of a thunderclap as startled them.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:13.170" end="00:04:16.156"-->They all withdrew a pace or so
and bowed.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:16.156" end="00:04:18.664"-->Then came one laughing towards me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:18.664" end="00:04:22.569"-->carrying a chain of
beautiful flowers altogether new to me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:22.569" end="00:04:24.537"-->and put it about my neck.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:04:24.581" end="00:04:27.924"-->The idea was received with melodious applause;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:27.924" end="00:04:31.634"-->and presently they
were all running to and fro for flowers,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:31.634" end="00:04:34.076"-->and laughingly flinging
them upon me<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:34.076" end="00:04:36.618"-->until I was almost smothered with blossom.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:37.054" end="00:04:42.488"-->You who
have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and
wonderful flowers<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:42.488" end="00:04:45.108"-->countless years of culture had created.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:45.257" end="00:04:50.455"-->Then
someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the
nearest building,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:50.455" end="00:04:53.903"-->and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:04:53.903" end="00:04:58.435"-->which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my
astonishment,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:58.435" end="00:05:02.153"-->towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:02.328" end="00:05:04.091"-->As I
went with them<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:04.091" end="00:05:10.726"-->the memory of my confident anticipations of a
profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:10.726" end="00:05:13.973"-->with irresistible
merriment, to my mind.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:05:14.827" end="00:05:17.309"--><p>'The building had a huge entry,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:17.309" end="00:05:20.365"-->and was altogether of colossal
dimensions.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:20.365" end="00:05:24.440"-->I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of
little people,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:24.440" end="00:05:29.430"-->and with the big open portals that yawned before me
shadowy and mysterious.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:29.430" end="00:05:33.505"-->My general impression of the world I saw
over their heads<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:33.505" end="00:05:37.162"-->was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and
flowers,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:37.162" end="00:05:40.566"-->a long neglected and yet weedless garden.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:40.793" end="00:05:45.116"-->I saw a number
of tall spikes of strange white flowers,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:45.116" end="00:05:49.348"-->measuring a foot perhaps
across the spread of the waxen petals.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:49.348" end="00:05:50.850"-->They grew scattered,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:50.850" end="00:05:54.024"-->as if
wild, among the variegated shrubs,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:54.024" end="00:05:55.748"-->but, as I say,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:55.748" end="00:05:58.760"-->I did not examine
them closely at this time.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:58.778" end="00:06:03.462"-->The Time Machine was left deserted on the
turf among the rhododendrons.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:06:03.885" end="00:06:06.915"--><p>'The arch of the doorway was richly carved,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:06.915" end="00:06:10.311"-->but naturally I did
not observe the carving very narrowly,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:10.311" end="00:06:15.823"-->though I fancied I saw
suggestions of old Phoenician decorations as I passed through,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:15.823" end="00:06:20.351"-->and
it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather-worn.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:06:20.708" end="00:06:24.404"-->Several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:24.404" end="00:06:25.933"-->and so we
entered,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:25.933" end="00:06:29.733"-->I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:29.733" end="00:06:31.444"-->looking
grotesque enough,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:31.444" end="00:06:33.221"-->garlanded with flowers,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:33.221" end="00:06:38.955"-->and surrounded by an
eddying mass of bright, soft-colored robes and shining white limbs,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:06:38.955" end="00:06:42.881"-->in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:06:43.474" end="00:06:48.680"--><p>'The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with
brown.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:48.751" end="00:06:50.801"-->The roof was in shadow,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:50.801" end="00:06:54.719"-->and the windows, partially glazed
with coloured glass and<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:54.772" end="00:06:58.403"-->partially unglazed, admitted a tempered
light.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:58.603" end="00:07:02.900"-->The floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white
metal,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:02.900" end="00:07:06.305"-->not plates nor slabs — blocks,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:06.305" end="00:07:12.078"-->and it was so much worn, as I
judged by the going to and fro of past generations,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:12.078" end="00:07:15.853"-->as to be deeply
channelled along the more frequented ways.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:15.853" end="00:07:22.031"-->Transverse to the length
were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:22.031" end="00:07:24.421"-->raised
perhaps a foot from the floor,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:24.421" end="00:07:27.255"-->and upon these were heaps of fruits.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:07:27.255" end="00:07:32.519"-->Some I recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:07:32.519" end="00:07:35.165"-->but for the most part they were strange.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:35.549" end="00:07:39.441"--><p>'Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:07:39.441" end="00:07:42.589"-->Upon these my conductors seated themselves,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:42.589" end="00:07:44.940"-->signing for me to do
likewise.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:44.940" end="00:07:47.239"-->With a pretty absence of ceremony<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:47.239" end="00:07:49.668"-->they began to eat the
fruit with their hands,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:49.668" end="00:07:52.489"-->flinging peel and stalks, and so forth,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:52.489" end="00:07:56.003"-->into
the round openings in the sides of the tables.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:56.003" end="00:07:58.811"-->I was not loath to
follow their example,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:58.811" end="00:08:01.013"-->for I felt thirsty and hungry.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:01.057" end="00:08:04.618"-->As I did so I
surveyed the hall at my leisure.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:08:05.133" end="00:08:09.947"--><p>'And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:08:10.017" end="00:08:14.693"-->The stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical
pattern,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:14.693" end="00:08:16.848"-->were broken in many places,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:16.848" end="00:08:21.428"-->and the curtains that hung
across the lower end were thick with dust.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:21.433" end="00:08:23.366"-->And it caught my eye<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:23.366" end="00:08:26.692"-->that
the corner of the marble table near me was fractured.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:27.023" end="00:08:31.830"-->Nevertheless,
the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:31.830" end="00:08:36.140"-->There were,
perhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:36.140" end="00:08:40.032"-->and most of
them, seated as near to me as they could come,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:40.032" end="00:08:42.187"-->were watching me with
interest,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:42.187" end="00:08:45.617"-->their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:08:45.662" end="00:08:50.267"-->All were clad in the same soft and yet strong, silky material.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:08:50.729" end="00:08:53.720"--><p>'Fruit, by the by, was all their diet.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:53.720" end="00:08:57.443"-->These people of the remote
future were strict vegetarians,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:57.443" end="00:09:01.322"-->and while I was with them, in spite
of some carnal cravings,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:01.322" end="00:09:03.864"-->I had to be frugivorous also.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:03.882" end="00:09:09.394"-->Indeed, I
found afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:09.394" end="00:09:12.955"-->had followed the
Ichthyosaurus into extinction.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:13.025" end="00:09:15.402"-->But the fruits were very delightful;<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:09:15.402" end="00:09:19.791"-->one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was
there<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:19.791" end="00:09:22.664"-->— a floury thing in a three-sided husk<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:22.664" end="00:09:26.329"-->— was especially good,
and I made it my staple.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:26.713" end="00:09:30.618"-->At first I was puzzled by all these strange
fruits,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:30.618" end="00:09:32.826"-->and by the strange flowers I saw,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:32.826" end="00:09:35.812"-->but later I began to
perceive their import.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:09:36.326" end="00:09:40.958"--><p>'However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future
now.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:41.080" end="00:09:44.346"-->So soon as my appetite was a little checked,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:44.346" end="00:09:49.831"-->I determined to
make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of
mine.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:49.831" end="00:09:52.295"-->Clearly that was the next thing to do.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:52.295" end="00:09:55.474"-->The fruits seemed a
convenient thing to begin upon,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:55.474" end="00:09:57.420"-->and holding one of these up<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:57.420" end="00:10:01.320"-->I began
a series of interrogative sounds and gestures.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:01.320" end="00:10:05.822"-->I had some
considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:05.871" end="00:10:11.800"-->At first my efforts
met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:11.800" end="00:10:16.241"-->but
presently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:10:16.241" end="00:10:18.052"-->and repeated a name.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:18.174" end="00:10:22.524"-->They had to chatter and explain the business
at great length to each other,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:22.524" end="00:10:27.056"-->and my first attempts to make the
exquisite little sounds of their language<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:27.056" end="00:10:29.519"-->caused an immense amount
of amusement.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:29.564" end="00:10:33.613"-->However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:10:33.613" end="00:10:34.984"-->and persisted,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:34.984" end="00:10:39.869"-->and presently I had a score of noun substantives at
least at my command;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:39.869" end="00:10:42.991"-->and then I got to demonstrative pronouns,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:42.991" end="00:10:45.211"-->and
even the verb "to eat."<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:45.211" end="00:10:47.039"-->But it was slow work,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:47.092" end="00:10:51.924"-->and the little people
soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:51.924" end="00:10:54.719"-->so I
determined, rather of necessity,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:54.719" end="00:10:59.147"-->to let them give their lessons in
little doses when they felt inclined.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:59.147" end="00:11:03.013"-->And very little doses I found
they were before long,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:03.013" end="00:11:07.384"-->for I never met people more indolent or more
easily fatigued.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:11:07.937" end="00:11:12.065"--><p>'A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:12.065" end="00:11:14.390"-->and that was
their lack of interest.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:14.390" end="00:11:18.791"-->They would come to me with eager cries of
astonishment, like children,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:18.791" end="00:11:24.316"-->but like children they would soon stop
examining me and wander away after some other toy.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:24.499" end="00:11:27.921"-->The dinner and my
conversational beginnings ended,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:27.921" end="00:11:33.572"-->I noted for the first time that
almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:33.720" end="00:11:35.392"-->It is
odd, too,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:35.392" end="00:11:39.397"-->how speedily I came to disregard these little people.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:39.572" end="00:11:44.987"-->I
went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as
my hunger was satisfied.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:45.057" end="00:11:48.610"-->I was continually meeting more of these men
of the future,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:48.610" end="00:11:52.633"-->who would follow me a little distance, chatter and
laugh about me,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:52.633" end="00:11:56.551"-->and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly
way,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:56.551" end="00:11:59.381"-->leave me again to my own devices.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:12:00.339" end="00:12:05.224"--><p>'The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great
hall,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:05.224" end="00:12:08.942"-->and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:12:09.090" end="00:12:12.094"-->At first things were very confusing.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:12.094" end="00:12:15.738"-->Everything was so entirely
different from the world I had known<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:15.738" end="00:12:17.392"-->— even the flowers.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:17.392" end="00:12:22.460"-->The big
building I had left was situated on the slope of a broad river
valley,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:22.460" end="00:12:26.569"-->but the Thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present
position.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:26.827" end="00:12:29.779"-->I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:29.779" end="00:12:31.764"-->perhaps a
mile and a half away,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:31.764" end="00:12:35.239"-->from which I could get a wider view of this
our planet<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:35.239" end="00:12:40.001"-->in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred
and One A.D.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:40.124" end="00:12:42.253"-->For that, I should explain,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:42.253" end="00:12:45.709"-->was the date the little
dials of my machine recorded.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:12:46.719" end="00:12:53.773"--><p>'As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly
help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:53.773" end="00:12:55.653"-->in which I
found the world<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:55.653" end="00:12:58.148"-->— for ruinous it was.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:58.148" end="00:13:00.982"-->A little way up the hill, for
instance,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:00.982" end="00:13:02.641"-->was a great heap of granite,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:02.641" end="00:13:05.319"-->bound together by masses of
aluminium,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:05.319" end="00:13:09.276"-->a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled
heaps,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:09.276" end="00:13:13.952"-->amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like
plants<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:13.952" end="00:13:15.533"-->— nettles possibly<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:15.533" end="00:13:18.550"-->— but wonderfully tinted with brown about
the leaves,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:18.550" end="00:13:20.352"-->and incapable of stinging.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:20.352" end="00:13:24.649"-->It was evidently the derelict
remains of some vast structure,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:24.649" end="00:13:27.661"-->to what end built I could not
determine.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:27.719" end="00:13:31.402"-->It was here that I was destined, at a later date,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:31.402" end="00:13:33.936"-->to have
a very strange experience<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:33.936" end="00:13:37.345"-->— the first intimation of a still stranger
discovery<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:37.345" end="00:13:40.644"-->— but of that I will speak in its proper place.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:13:41.119" end="00:13:43.549"--><p>'Looking round with a sudden thought,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:43.549" end="00:13:46.318"-->from a terrace on which I
rested for a while,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:46.318" end="00:13:50.375"-->I realized that there were no small houses to be
seen.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:50.419" end="00:13:52.862"-->Apparently the single house,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:52.862" end="00:13:56.553"-->and possibly even the household,
had vanished.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:56.767" end="00:14:00.868"-->Here and there among the greenery were palace-like
buildings,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:00.868" end="00:14:08.138"-->but the house and the cottage, which form such
characteristic features of our own English landscape, had
disappeared.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:14:08.391" end="00:14:11.769"--><p>'"Communism," said I to myself.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:14:12.075" end="00:14:15.196"--><p>'And on the heels of that came another thought.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:15.196" end="00:14:19.062"-->I looked at the
half-dozen little figures that were following me.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:19.062" end="00:14:20.930"-->Then, in a flash,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:14:20.930" end="00:14:24.169"-->I perceived that all had the same form of costume,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:24.169" end="00:14:26.520"-->the same soft
hairless visage,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:26.520" end="00:14:29.324"-->and the same girlish rotundity of limb.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:29.733" end="00:14:33.861"-->It may seem
strange, perhaps, that I had not noticed this before.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:33.861" end="00:14:36.577"-->But everything
was so strange.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:36.577" end="00:14:40.208"-->Now, I saw the fact plainly enough.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:40.208" end="00:14:46.791"-->In costume, and
in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the
sexes from each other,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:46.791" end="00:14:49.808"-->these people of the future were alike.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:49.808" end="00:14:54.746"-->And
the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their
parents.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:54.746" end="00:14:59.278"-->I judged, then, that the children of that time were
extremely precocious,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:14:59.278" end="00:15:01.067"-->physically at least,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:01.067" end="00:15:05.098"-->and I found afterwards
abundant verification of my opinion.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:15:06.187" end="00:15:10.236"--><p>'Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:10.236" end="00:15:14.528"-->I
felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:14.546" end="00:15:16.244"-->what
one would expect;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:16.244" end="00:15:19.666"-->for the strength of a man and the softness of a
woman,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:19.666" end="00:15:21.717"-->the institution of the family,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:21.717" end="00:15:28.274"-->and the differentiation of
occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical
force;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:28.274" end="00:15:31.186"-->where population is balanced and abundant,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:31.186" end="00:15:33.472"-->much childbearing
becomes an evil<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:33.472" end="00:15:35.753"-->rather than a blessing to the State;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:35.979" end="00:15:39.571"-->where
violence comes but rarely and off-spring are secure,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:39.571" end="00:15:43.843"-->there is less
necessity — indeed there is no necessity<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:43.843" end="00:15:45.906"-->— for an efficient family,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:15:45.906" end="00:15:51.844"-->and the specialization of the sexes with reference to their
children's needs disappears.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:51.993" end="00:15:55.546"-->We see some beginnings of this even
in our own time,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:55.546" end="00:15:58.484"-->and in this future age it was complete.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:15:58.484" end="00:16:00.653"-->This, I
must remind you,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:00.653" end="00:16:03.121"-->was my speculation at the time.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:03.121" end="00:16:08.667"-->Later, I was to
appreciate how far it fell short of the reality.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:16:10.044" end="00:16:16.287"--><p>'While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by
a pretty little structure,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:16.287" end="00:16:18.437"-->like a well under a cupola.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:18.533" end="00:16:23.471"-->I thought in
a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:23.471" end="00:16:26.553"-->and then
resumed the thread of my speculations.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:26.553" end="00:16:29.779"-->There were no large buildings
towards the top of the hill,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:29.779" end="00:16:33.371"-->and as my walking powers were evidently
miraculous,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:33.371" end="00:16:36.697"-->I was presently left alone for the first time.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:37.002" end="00:16:41.999"-->With a
strange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:16:42.096" end="00:16:47.438"--><p>'There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognize,<!--/audio-->

in soft moss,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:53.564" end="00:16:58.906"-->the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of
griffins' heads.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:16:58.906" end="00:17:00.721"-->I sat down on it,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:00.721" end="00:17:06.790"-->and I surveyed the broad view of
our old world under the sunset of that long day.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:07.121" end="00:17:11.204"-->It was as sweet and
fair a view as I have ever seen.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:11.301" end="00:17:14.422"-->The sun had already gone below the
horizon<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:14.422" end="00:17:16.721"-->and the west was flaming gold,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:16.721" end="00:17:20.935"-->touched with some horizontal
bars of purple and crimson.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:21.214" end="00:17:23.813"-->Below was the valley of the Thames,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:23.813" end="00:17:27.235"-->in
which the river lay like a band of burnished steel.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:27.235" end="00:17:32.342"-->I have already
spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated
greenery,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:32.342" end="00:17:35.459"-->some in ruins and some still occupied.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:35.582" end="00:17:40.702"-->Here and there rose
a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:40.702" end="00:17:45.822"-->here and
there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:45.822" end="00:17:47.519"-->There
were no hedges,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:47.519" end="00:17:50.132"-->no signs of proprietary rights,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:50.132" end="00:17:52.483"-->no evidences of
agriculture;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:17:52.483" end="00:17:55.155"-->the whole earth had become a garden.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:17:55.813" end="00:18:01.325"--><p>'So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had
seen,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:01.325" end="00:18:04.173"-->and as it shaped itself to me that evening,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:04.173" end="00:18:07.106"-->my interpretation
was something in this way.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:07.151" end="00:18:11.487"-->(Afterwards I found I had got only a
half-truth<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:18:11.487" end="00:18:14.734"-->— or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)<!--/audio-->
