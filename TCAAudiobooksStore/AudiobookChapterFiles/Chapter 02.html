by H. G. Wells</h1><!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:00:18.094" end="00:00:20.341"--><p>I think that at that time<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:20.341" end="00:00:23.136"-->none of us quite believed in the Time
Machine.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:23.206" end="00:00:28.757"-->The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who
are too clever to be believed:<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:28.757" end="00:00:31.696"-->you never felt that you saw all round
him;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:31.696" end="00:00:34.687"-->you always suspected some subtle reserve,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:34.687" end="00:00:36.832"-->some ingenuity in
ambush,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:36.832" end="00:00:39.105"-->behind his lucid frankness.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:39.104" end="00:00:44.107"-->Had Filby shown the model and
explained the matter in the Time Traveller's words,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:44.107" end="00:00:47.333"-->we should have
shown <i>him</i> far less scepticism.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:47.333" end="00:00:50.076"-->For we should have perceived his
motives;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:50.076" end="00:00:52.571"-->a pork butcher could understand Filby.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:52.571" end="00:00:57.051"-->But the Time
Traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:57.051" end="00:00:59.071"-->and we
distrusted him.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:00:59.102" end="00:01:02.680"-->Things that would have made the frame of a less
clever man<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:02.680" end="00:01:05.162"-->seemed tricks in his hands.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:05.162" end="00:01:08.140"-->It is a mistake to do things
too easily.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:08.140" end="00:01:13.299"-->The serious people who took him seriously never felt
quite sure of his deportment;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:13.299" end="00:01:17.857"-->they were somehow aware that trusting
their reputations for judgment with him<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:17.857" end="00:01:21.084"-->was like furnishing a
nursery with egg-shell china.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:21.084" end="00:01:27.784"-->So I don't think any of us said very
much about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and
the next,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:27.784" end="00:01:33.165"-->though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of
our minds:<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:33.165" end="00:01:35.386"-->its plausibility, that is,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:35.386" end="00:01:37.645"-->its practical incredibleness,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:01:37.645" end="00:01:40.401"-->the curious possibilities of anachronism<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:40.401" end="00:01:43.204"-->and of utter confusion it
suggested.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:43.510" end="00:01:45.247"-->For my own part,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:45.247" end="00:01:48.808"-->I was particularly preoccupied with the
trick of the model.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:48.865" end="00:01:52.078"-->That I remember discussing with the Medical Man,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:01:52.078" end="00:01:54.542"-->whom I met on Friday at the Linnaean.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:54.586" end="00:01:57.720"-->He said he had seen a similar
thing at Tubingen,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:01:57.720" end="00:02:01.534"-->and laid considerable stress on the blowing out
of the candle.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:01.534" end="00:02:04.991"-->But how the trick was done he could not explain.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:02:05.949" end="00:02:08.796"--><p>The next Thursday I went again to Richmond<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:08.796" end="00:02:13.015"-->— I suppose I was one of
the Time Traveller's most constant guests<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:13.014" end="00:02:18.279"-->— and, arriving late, found
four or five men already assembled in his drawing-room.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:18.427" end="00:02:24.501"-->The Medical
Man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand
and his watch in the other.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:24.501" end="00:02:27.805"-->I looked round for the Time Traveller,
and<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:27.805" end="00:02:31.653"-->— 'It's half-past seven now,' said the Medical Man.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:31.653" end="00:02:34.248"-->'I suppose
we'd better have dinner?'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:02:34.684" end="00:02:38.367"--><p>'Where's —  — ?' said I, naming our host.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:02:38.367" end="00:02:40.065"--><p>'You've just come?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:40.065" end="00:02:41.619"-->It's rather odd.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:41.619" end="00:02:44.127"-->He's unavoidably detained.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:44.127" end="00:02:48.829"-->He
asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he's not
back.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:48.829" end="00:02:51.632"-->Says he'll explain when he comes.'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:02:52.225" end="00:02:55.177"--><p>'It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:55.177" end="00:02:58.324"-->said the Editor of a
well-known daily paper;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:02:58.324" end="00:03:00.989"-->and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:03:01.425" end="00:03:07.702"--><p>The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself
who had attended the previous dinner.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:07.773" end="00:03:09.680"-->The other men were Blank,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:09.680" end="00:03:11.769"-->the
Editor aforementioned,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:11.769" end="00:03:14.329"-->a certain journalist, and another<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:14.329" end="00:03:18.256"-->— a quiet,
shy man with a beard — whom I didn't know,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:18.256" end="00:03:20.920"-->and who, as far as my
observation went,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:20.920" end="00:03:23.436"-->never opened his mouth all the evening.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:23.637" end="00:03:28.561"-->There was
some speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller's
absence,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:28.561" end="00:03:32.618"-->and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:03:32.688" end="00:03:35.301"-->The Editor wanted that explained to him,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:35.301" end="00:03:38.932"-->and the Psychologist
volunteered a wooden account of the<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:38.932" end="00:03:41.322"-->'ingenious paradox and trick'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:41.322" end="00:03:43.629"-->we
had witnessed that day week.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:43.647" end="00:03:50.282"-->He was in the midst of his exposition
when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:50.282" end="00:03:53.312"-->I
was facing the door, and saw it first.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:53.312" end="00:03:56.559"-->'Hallo!' I said. 'At last!'<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:03:56.708" end="00:03:58.667"-->And the door opened wider,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:03:58.667" end="00:04:01.423"-->and the Time Traveller stood before us.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:04:01.423" end="00:04:03.787"-->I gave a cry of surprise.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:03.787" end="00:04:06.360"-->'Good heavens! man, what's the matter?'<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:04:06.360" end="00:04:09.221"-->cried the Medical Man, who saw him next.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:09.221" end="00:04:12.233"-->And the whole tableful
turned towards the door.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:04:13.187" end="00:04:15.825"--><p>He was in an amazing plight.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:15.825" end="00:04:18.320"-->His coat was dusty and dirty,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:21.102"-->and
smeared with green down the sleeves;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:21.102" end="00:04:22.617"-->his hair disordered,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:22.617" end="00:04:24.981"-->and as it
seemed to me greyer<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:24.981" end="00:04:26.980"-->— either with dust and dirt<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:26.980" end="00:04:29.600"-->or because its colour
had actually faded.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:29.670" end="00:04:32.152"-->His face was ghastly pale;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:32.152" end="00:04:36.188"-->his chin had a brown
cut on it — a cut half healed;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:36.188" end="00:04:38.708"-->his expression was haggard and drawn,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:04:38.708" end="00:04:40.937"-->as by intense suffering.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:41.190" end="00:04:44.103"-->For a moment he hesitated in the doorway,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:04:44.103" end="00:04:46.911"-->as if he had been dazzled by the light.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:46.911" end="00:04:48.957"-->Then he came into the room.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:04:49.053" end="00:04:53.711"-->He walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:04:53.833" end="00:04:56.106"-->We stared at him in silence,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:04:56.106" end="00:04:58.047"-->expecting him to speak.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:04:58.379" end="00:05:01.853"--><p>He said not a word, but came painfully to the table,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:01.853" end="00:05:04.108"-->and made a
motion towards the wine.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:04.282" end="00:05:08.175"-->The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and
pushed it towards him.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:08.193" end="00:05:09.655"-->He drained it,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:09.655" end="00:05:11.654"-->and it seemed to do him good:<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:05:11.654" end="00:05:16.939"-->for he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smile
flickered across his face.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:17.113" end="00:05:21.641"-->'What on earth have you been up to, man?'
said the Doctor.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:21.737" end="00:05:24.671"-->The Time Traveller did not seem to hear.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:26.152" end="00:05:29.138"-->'Don't let
me disturb you,'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:29.286" end="00:05:32.795"-->he said, with a certain faltering articulation.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:05:33.179" end="00:05:35.538"-->'I'm all right.'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:35.634" end="00:05:38.717"-->He stopped, held out his glass for more,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:38.717" end="00:05:40.945"-->and took
it off at a draught.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:41.011" end="00:05:43.701"-->'That's good,' he said.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:43.745" end="00:05:45.508"-->His eyes grew brighter,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:05:45.508" end="00:05:48.330"-->and a faint colour came into his cheeks.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:48.330" end="00:05:52.431"-->His glance flickered over
our faces with a certain dull approval,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:52.431" end="00:05:55.391"-->and then went round the warm
and comfortable room.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:55.691" end="00:05:57.337"-->Then he spoke again,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:05:57.337" end="00:06:01.002"-->still as it were feeling
his way among his words.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:04.638"-->'I'm going to wash and dress,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:04.638" end="00:06:07.629"-->and then I'll
come down and explain things …<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:07.629" end="00:06:09.692"-->Save me some of that mutton.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:09.692" end="00:06:12.495"-->I'm
starving for a bit of meat.'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:06:12.958" end="00:06:16.354"--><p>He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:16.406" end="00:06:18.235"-->and hoped he
was all right.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:18.235" end="00:06:20.490"-->The Editor began a question.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:20.586" end="00:06:24.295"-->'Tell you presently,'
said the Time Traveller.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:24.705" end="00:06:27.744"-->'I'm — funny!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:27.944" end="00:06:30.774"-->Be all right in a minute.'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:06:31.288" end="00:06:35.128"--><p>He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:35.128" end="00:06:39.864"-->Again
I remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:06:39.864" end="00:06:43.992"-->and standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:43.992" end="00:06:48.289"-->He had
nothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:48.289" end="00:06:50.483"-->Then the
door closed upon him.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:50.483" end="00:06:56.212"-->I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered
how he detested any fuss about himself.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:56.322" end="00:06:59.770"-->For a minute, perhaps, my
mind was wool-gathering.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:06:59.770" end="00:07:04.916"-->Then, 'Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent
Scientist,'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:04.916" end="00:07:06.666"-->I heard the Editor say,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:06.666" end="00:07:09.709"-->thinking (after his wont) in
headlines.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:09.709" end="00:07:13.087"-->And this brought my attention back to the bright
dinner-table.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:13.706" end="00:07:15.300"--><p>'What's the game?'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:15.300" end="00:07:16.802"-->said the Journalist.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:16.802" end="00:07:19.283"-->'Has he been doing the
Amateur Cadger?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:19.283" end="00:07:20.754"-->I don't follow.'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:21.060" end="00:07:26.180"-->I met the eye of the Psychologist,
and read my own interpretation in his face.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:26.180" end="00:07:30.124"-->I thought of the Time
Traveller limping painfully upstairs.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:30.124" end="00:07:33.345"-->I don't think any one else had
noticed his lameness.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:07:34.199" end="00:07:39.719"--><p>The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical
Man, who rang the bell<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:39.815" end="00:07:43.446"-->— the Time Traveller hated to have servants
waiting at dinner<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:43.446" end="00:07:45.171"-->— for a hot plate.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:45.171" end="00:07:49.024"-->At that the Editor turned to his
knife and fork with a grunt,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:49.024" end="00:07:51.492"-->and the Silent Man followed suit.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:51.492" end="00:07:53.538"-->The
dinner was resumed.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:53.582" end="00:07:57.265"-->Conversation was exclamatory for a little while,<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:07:57.265" end="00:07:59.028"-->with gaps of wonderment;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:07:59.028" end="00:08:02.406"-->and then the Editor got fervent in his
curiosity.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:02.451" end="00:08:06.612"-->'Does our friend eke out his modest income with a
crossing?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:06.612" end="00:08:10.047"-->or has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:10.047" end="00:08:11.267"-->he inquired.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:11.319" end="00:08:16.439"-->'I feel
assured it's this business of the Time Machine,' I said,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:16.439" end="00:08:19.948"-->and took up
the Psychologist's account of our previous meeting.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:20.645" end="00:08:23.923"-->The new guests
were frankly incredulous.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:23.923" end="00:08:26.308"-->The Editor raised objections.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:26.953" end="00:08:29.239"-->'What <i>was</i>
this time travelling?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:29.239" end="00:08:34.420"-->A man couldn't cover himself with dust by
rolling in a paradox, could he?'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:34.437" end="00:08:37.415"-->And then, as the idea came home to
him,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:37.415" end="00:08:39.257"-->he resorted to caricature.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:39.257" end="00:08:42.531"-->Hadn't they any clothes-brushes in
the Future?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:42.757" end="00:08:46.650"-->The Journalist too, would not believe at any price,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:46.650" end="00:08:51.177"-->and
joined the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole
thing.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:51.234" end="00:08:53.846"-->They were both the new kind of journalist<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:53.846" end="00:08:56.388"-->— very joyous,
irreverent young men.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:08:56.720" end="00:09:01.043"-->'Our Special Correspondent in the Day
after To-morrow reports,'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:01.043" end="00:09:02.820"-->the Journalist was saying<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:02.820" end="00:09:06.328"-->— or rather
shouting — when the Time Traveller came back.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:06.424" end="00:09:13.355"-->He was dressed in
ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained
of the change that had startled me.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:09:13.817" end="00:09:15.215"--><p>'I say,'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:15.215" end="00:09:17.474"-->said the Editor hilariously,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:17.474" end="00:09:25.402"-->'these chaps here say you have
been travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about
little Rosebery, will you?<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:25.402" end="00:09:27.448"-->What will you take for the lot?'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:09:28.145" end="00:09:32.855"--><p>The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a
word.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:33.840" end="00:09:36.774"-->He smiled quietly, in his old way.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:37.079" end="00:09:39.778"-->'Where's my mutton?' he
said.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:39.926" end="00:09:43.487"-->'What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:09:43.740" end="00:09:46.595"--><p>'Story!' cried the Editor.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:09:46.639" end="00:09:50.095"--><p>'Story be damned!' said the Time Traveller.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:50.140" end="00:09:52.164"-->'I want something to
eat.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:09:52.164" end="00:09:56.082"-->I won't say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:09:56.082" end="00:09:58.624"-->Thanks. And the salt.'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:09:59.034" end="00:10:01.263"--><p>'One word,' said I.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:01.359" end="00:10:03.431"-->'Have you been time travelling?'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:10:03.841" end="00:10:05.278"--><p>'Yes,'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:05.278" end="00:10:09.178"-->said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his
head.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:10:09.849" end="00:10:14.664"--><p>'I'd give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,' said the Editor.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:10:16.066" end="00:10:21.095"-->The Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang
it with his fingernail;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:21.095" end="00:10:25.980"-->at which the Silent Man, who had been
staring at his face, started convulsively,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:25.980" end="00:10:27.612"-->and poured him wine.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:10:27.612" end="00:10:31.074"-->The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:31.780" end="00:10:36.064"-->For my own part, sudden
questions kept on rising to my lips,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:36.064" end="00:10:38.963"-->and I dare say it was the same
with the others.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:38.963" end="00:10:43.778"-->The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by
telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:43.874" end="00:10:47.427"-->The Time Traveller devoted his
attention to his dinner,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:47.427" end="00:10:50.091"-->and displayed the appetite of a tramp.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:10:50.109" end="00:10:52.591"-->The Medical Man smoked a cigarette,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:52.591" end="00:10:55.752"-->and watched the Time Traveller
through his eyelashes.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:55.752" end="00:10:59.135"-->The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than
usual,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:10:59.135" end="00:11:04.289"-->and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of
sheer nervousness.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:04.594" end="00:11:08.756"-->At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away,
and looked round us.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:09.296" end="00:11:13.327"-->'I suppose I must apologize,' he said.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:13.366" end="00:11:15.744"-->'I was
simply starving.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:15.744" end="00:11:17.972"-->I've had a most amazing time.'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:18.173" end="00:11:21.682"-->He reached out his
hand for a cigar, and cut the end.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:21.987" end="00:11:24.207"-->'But come into the smoking-room.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:11:24.207" end="00:11:27.877"-->It's too long a story to tell over greasy plates.'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:27.877" end="00:11:32.227"-->And ringing the
bell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining room.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:11:33.812" end="00:11:37.926"--><p>'You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:37.926" end="00:11:43.264"-->he
said to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new
guests.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:11:43.412" end="00:11:47.391"--><p>'But the thing's a mere paradox,' said the Editor.<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:11:47.722" end="00:11:50.230"--><p>'I can't argue to-night.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:50.382" end="00:11:53.908"-->I don't mind telling you the story, but
I can't argue.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:53.908" end="00:11:56.886"-->I will,' he went on,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:11:56.886" end="00:12:00.792"-->'tell you the story of what
has happened to me, if you like,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:00.792" end="00:12:03.543"-->but you must refrain from
interruptions.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:03.560" end="00:12:06.494"-->I want to tell it. Badly.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:06.494" end="00:12:10.178"-->Most of it will sound like
lying. So be it!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:10.178" end="00:12:13.686"-->It's true — every word of it, all the same.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:13.939" end="00:12:18.127"-->I was in
my laboratory at four o'clock, and since then …<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:18.197" end="00:12:20.313"-->I've lived eight
days …<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:20.313" end="00:12:24.341"-->such days as no human being ever lived before!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:24.341" end="00:12:29.304"-->I'm nearly
worn out, but I shan't sleep till I've told this thing over to you.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:12:29.304" end="00:12:31.211"-->Then I shall go to bed.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:31.211" end="00:12:34.302"-->But no interruptions! Is it agreed?'<!--/audio-->

<!--audio start="00:12:34.372" end="00:12:37.011"--><p>'Agreed,' said the Editor,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:37.011" end="00:12:39.683"-->and the rest of us echoed 'Agreed.'<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:39.701" end="00:12:44.646"-->And
with that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:12:44.847" end="00:12:49.218"-->He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man.<!--/audio-->
<!--audio start="00:12:49.236" end="00:12:52.044"-->Afterwards he got more animated.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:52.044" end="00:12:55.531"-->In writing it down I feel with only
too much keenness<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:55.531" end="00:12:57.974"-->the inadequacy of pen and ink<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:12:57.974" end="00:13:00.599"-->— and, above all, my
own inadequacy<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:00.599" end="00:13:02.715"-->— to express its quality.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:02.715" end="00:13:06.215"-->You read, I will suppose,
attentively enough;<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:06.215" end="00:13:11.427"-->but you cannot see the speaker's white,
sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:11.427" end="00:13:14.353"-->nor hear the
intonation of his voice.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:14.352" end="00:13:18.728"-->You cannot know how his expression followed
the turns of his story!<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:18.824" end="00:13:21.332"-->Most of us hearers were in shadow,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:21.332" end="00:13:24.493"-->for the
candles in the smoking-room had not been lighted,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:24.493" end="00:13:31.006"-->and only the face
of the Journalist and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees
downward were illuminated.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:31.076" end="00:13:34.245"-->At first we glanced now and again at each
other.<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:34.263" end="00:13:37.202"-->After a time we ceased to do that,<!--/audio--> <!--audio start="00:13:37.202" end="00:13:40.344"-->and looked only at the
Time Traveller's face.<!--/audio-->
